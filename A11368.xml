            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE whole ſcope of this preſent Treatiſe is no other then to teach in a deuout and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t manner how to Reuerence and adore with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Inclinations our B. Lady and miſtriſſe the Queene of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; as a preparatiue to which, we haue indeauoured to declare,
<pb facs="tcp:95:4"/>her heroical vertues, greatneſſes, excellencies and ſublime prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues: And by the way is to be conſidered that although Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be peculiar to God alone, yet according to diuines diſtinction thereof, it alſo may be appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the B. Virgin, to Angels, and other Saints and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come common to God &amp; Man. As we may cleerly gather from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers paſſages of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as namely in Paralip. chap. 26. when it is ſayd; <hi>And they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and adored firſt God, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Adorations then admit a three-fould diſtinction of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria, Dulia, and Hyperdulia, where of the firſt is proper vnto God alone, in regard of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit and increated Greatnes; the
<pb facs="tcp:95:4"/>ſecond hath reference to ſuch creatures as aduance in ſanctity and glory aboue the reſt, which ſanctity and glory arriuing in any on to more ſublimity (as in the B. Virgin) with the more ſublime honour of Hyperdulia, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are to reuerence them: But before we proceed to the exerciſe of this Adoration we prefix an exhortation to deuotion towards her, and declare fiue Priuiledges, her ſeruants are indowed with al, ſetting down (as preamble to the worke) thoſe conditions and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which are requiſit in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uots. Then we paſſ to the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe Adorations, in the firſt Chapter, declaring their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, in the ſecond how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teful and acceptable they are to the B. Virgin, and in the fower
<pb facs="tcp:95:5"/>following ones, fower forcible argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are eſtabliſhed to proue her deſeruing that adoration. The firſt deduced from her being the Mother of Almighty God. The next for her being elected aboue al other Saints, and al the Quires of Heauen. The third for her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraine power and authority, ouer al Creatures: And the fourth and laſt for her being an affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat Mother vnto vs al. Then we come to the practiſe of theſe Adorations, (or Genuflexions) ſhewing how they are deuoutly to be performed, as wel in the interiour as exteriour, and heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon we take occaſion to inlarge our diſcourſe touching the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations due to God, to his Bleſſed Saints and Angels, &amp;c. Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remaine of the following
<pb facs="tcp:95:5"/>Chapters, in ſetting down diuers practical wayes of honouring the B. Virgin applying to euery on its proper Reuerence and Adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: but principally we inſiſt vpon thoſe twelue ſublime prerogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of hers, prefigured by the twelue Starres, in her crowne of which S. Iohn in his Apocalips make mention.</p>
            <p>Now this aduertiſement is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to al that although the choice of many exerciſes of adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be propoſed in this preſent worke, notwithſtanding they are only to fix on, which they may find moſt guſt and comfort in, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to beware-of entergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to much at once leaſt they become thereby but more negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in performance of them, and a too precipitious deſir of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming
<pb facs="tcp:95:6"/>ſoon to end, make them but haſt too much vpon the way, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them without fruit and deuotion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we councel rather to make choice of ſome few we may performe with mediocrity of deuotion, then of many with danger of tepidity &amp; diſtraction. Notwithſtanding when any feaſt occurs, vnto which we haue a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deuotion (as thoſe of our Bleſſed Sauiour his Mother or the like) we may then multiply our Genuflexions to a hundred a day, (for example) or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand diſtributed equally to ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dayes or nights of the octaue as we pleaſe, as we ſhal more largely declare in the following Treatiſe by the aſſiſtance of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and the fauour of
<pb facs="tcp:95:6"/>his holy Mother, al which we dedicat to the praiſe of God from whom al Good proceeds, to the Bleſſed Virgin his moſt holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to Saint Francis our Glorious Patriarch.</p>

Yet certaine it is withal ſhee beholds thoſe with a more deere regard
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95:14"/>who loue her and render her the moſt dutiful ſeruices and are moſt aſſidual in reuerencing her. And moſt laudable and holie is that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequiouſnes by whoſe exteriour ſignes is manifeſted the interiour affections of the hart, for ſo (as S. Gregory ſays) the proofe of the affection is the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the thing. Now how reciprocal the B. Virgins loue is to vs againe, her ſelf declares in thoſe words attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to her by the Holy Ghoſt; thoſe who loue mee, I loue; as much as to ſay, I haue a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar loue for thoſe who affect mee with al their hart and ſoule, and endeauour to render ſuch honour as they imagine the moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and what ſort of loue it is her ſelf declares in another paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of Scripture where ſhee ſayes:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95:14"/>I am the mother of beautious loue; ſignifying the loue ſhee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects her ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with, to be firme, compleat at al parts, and truly worthy ſo diuine and louing a mother.</p>
            <p>This glorious Queene tenders vs as her owne Children, in that ſhee is our Mother, and ſo neare and ſtrait a bond tyes vs together, as her being a deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant from our generation, fleſh of our fleſh, bloud of our bloud, bone of our bone, for which reaſon ſhee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but affect vs much, eſpecially if wee endeauour to deſerue it by our conſtancie and fidelitie in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her. Shee is the Mother of <hi>Ieſus-Chriſt</hi> true God and Man, God is our Father: <hi>Our Father which art in heauen:</hi> his Sonne Ieſus-Chriſt our brother: Go to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95:15"/>my brothers, (ſayes he to Mary Magdalen: Oh infinit ſweetnes of loue!) Go to my brothers and tel them, I aſcend to my father &amp; your father, to my God and yours. The Bleſſed Virgin is then our Mother, Ieſus Chriſt the increated Word our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Eternal father our father.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Conforme to this, S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard on theſe words, <hi>Ecce mater tua,</hi> behold thy Mother, argues thus: If Mary be thy mother, O man, (ſayes he,) then Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is thy brother, his father thine, his Kingdom thou haſt right to, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the grace of Mary is thy riches, ſince the mother Vſually layes vp for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo thy neceſſities goe

And certainly our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moſt great and highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantag'd aboue al others, to haue the Mother of God, Empreſſe of the Vniuerſe, for Mother, and her only ſonne, the King of glory, glory of Kings, and our true God for brother. An honour the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels could neuer glorie in; For when or where (ſayes S. Paul) did God euer ſay to them as he ſayd to man, ſpeaking to our Sauiour Chriſt? Thou art my ſonne, to day I haue begotten thee.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſpirits, as happy as they are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95:16"/>haue neuer an Angel of them al, inueſted with their Angelical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they can ſay is God; whilſt wee inueſted with our humane haue the God of Angels himſelfe wee cannot only ſay is man but euen our brother too; nor do wee find it was euer ſayd to any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it was to man; Behold thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the perſon of S.

Let vs conclude then, that her loue is generally towards al; but in a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner towards thoſe who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume her for their Mother, and by moſt affectionat wayes ſeeke out her ſafeguard and protection.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95:16"/>
Moreouer wee muſt conclude this glorious Queen hath ſhewed more affection to men, then euer ſhee did to Angels: In imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the eternal Father, whom in her actions, shee of al others, moſt nearly imitats: and for proofe that his loue is more to vs then them, but conſider with what pretious guifts he hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured vs, for ſo the greatnes of the preſents giuen by the louer to its beloued manifeſtly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res the greatnes of its affection to it; and what guifts are thoſe the eternal Father hath beſtowed on the ſonnes of the earth! Let the Angels harke, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changels lend an eare, and al the heauenly Hierarchies remaine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſh't at ſo wondrous a libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Behold the infinit preſent,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95:17"/>the infinit guift with God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; preſented the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, neuer to be enough vallued neuer to be aequalled. God hath ſo loued the World, as for it he hath giuen his only ſonne; out of his exceſſiue loue to free it from the miſerie in which it was; and what on the Angels hath he beſtowed the whilſt? nothing but their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal beatitud merited (as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines hold) by one ſole act of their Wil; another thing it is, and of other valuation which he hath beſtowed on men, to giue his owne Sonne to ſaue them, then his giuing the Angels their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal beatitud; ſo ſayes S. Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, To giue his only Sonne for the impieties of men was a greater matter, then to the merits of Angels to giue eternal life. Let
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95:17"/>vs grant then and freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the loue of God &amp; his holy Mother, more ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>didly shinning on men then Angels, ſince more admirable haue been the effects produced of it, towards them then theſe, and more obliging to repay them reciprocally againe.</p>
            <p>But this is not al, nor doth our gratious Miſtris ſtay heere, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay affection with affection, but by the tranſport of her loue shee paſſes to honour her ſeruants, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes with her viſits, ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to comfort them with her owne deare preſence &amp; her Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſonns.</p>
            <p>An example of which, amongſt an infinitie of others, wee haue in the new reformed Mirrour of Examples, and it is this: There was a yong Virgin ſome. 14. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95:18"/>of age, ſo deuoted to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, as shee employed in her ſeruice almoſt al her dayes and nights; in which her pious exerciſes shee continued for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſeauen yeares ſpace, euer beſeeching her deere miſtres, &amp; patroneſſe ſo to fauour her, as shee might behold her B. Sonn iuſt as shee had brought him into the world; vntil at laſt one night) and 'tis beleued to haue been Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas night) retiring her ſelfe into an Oratorie shee had in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, &amp; there with prayers and teares iterating her petition, behold ſodainly there appeared vnto her the Queene of heauen, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with Myriads of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who gratiouſly reaching her, from her owne armes to hers, her heauenly Infant, ſayd: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95:18"/>heer my dear daughter, what you haue ſo much deſired; take him, embrace him, and at your pleaſure ſolace you with him; at this the deuout Virgin tooke him in her armes, and embracing and kiſſing him, vſed al the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes à deuout loue could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe an affection in; when in the heate of her kiſſes &amp; embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the diuine Infant darting a look at her, had been ableto haue pierc'd a farr harder hart, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hers asked her if shee loued him? that I do, ſaid shee, and confirmed it with a thouſand new blandish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: but how much do you loue mee? more then my body; and how much more? more then my very hart; yet, how much more then that? alaſſe, ſaid shee, it is impoſſible to tel you that, let it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95:19"/>ſpeak for mee, and ſo with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſigh shee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, and with that her life, her hart burſting in the midſt, vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to containe ſo much of loue was in it, when (we may piouſly imagine) the B. Virgin tooke her white ſoule in her armes, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering it into the hands of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, they with ſweete and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious harmonie conducted it to heauen. At ſound of which celeſtial muſick, thoſe of the houſe accurring &amp; forceing open the Oratory doore, found the dead corps extended on the ground, and exhaling ſo much ſweetnes, as it ſeemed al the moſt pretious perfumes of the world had gon to the embalming it. Amongſt the reſt, two Fathers of S. Dominicks Order were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95:19"/>who, as they diſſected her, to find out he cauſe of ſo ſudaine &amp; ſtrange a death, perceiued her hart inſcribed with theſe wordes in golden letters: O my Ieſus, I loue thee more then my ſelfe, for hauing Created, redeemed, and adopted mee by thy holy grace. Whereby wee may perceaue, how great was the loue shee bore to the ſacred Mother and her Sonne, and how greatly they are aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag'd by it, who loue them with ſuch tendernes of affection.</p>
            <p>I am inuited by this ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an Example, to the recital of one other no leſſe excellent, taken out of the firſt part of our Chronicles of S. Francis, one of the moſt Exemplar patterns of deuotion to the B. Virgin as euer was. This holy Saint in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95:20"/>viſiting a certaine Conuent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewhat remote, had appointed him for companion one of raw yeares and rawer experience in Religion. They being arriued at their iourneys end, the Saint after ſome light refection, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe ſome-what more early then ordinary to his repoſe, the bitter to riſe at the accuſtom'd houre of Mattins with the reſt. Meane while his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out one of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uent of as litle ſpirit as himſelf, began with bitter inuectiues to inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Saint, ſaying (by way of mockery) that he could eate, drinke, and ſleepe with the beſt of them, and euen to paſſion ſeek his owne commodities, the whilſt he kept them ſhort enough, and ſlinted them as he liſted; &amp; after
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95:20"/>many ſuch idle &amp; miſbe ſeeming ſpeeches, reſolued at laſt to watch him narrowly that night; whither he roſe at the nocturnal Houres with the reſt or no, and ſo he did. When behold, about the ſecond Vigil of night he might perceaue him riſe &amp; take his way towards the adioyning Wood, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſtil with his obſeruation, at laſt he ſaw him fal proſtrat on the ground directing many a ſigh to heauen &amp; many a praier wing'd with the fire of loue vnto the Queene of heauen, beſeeching her of the fauour to let him ſee her B. Sonne iuſt as he was infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the world: ſcarce had he vtter'd this, when the B. Virgin al enuironed with celeſtial light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto him &amp; with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſweetnes preſented him from

This amorous duel laſted til breake of day (not only to the exceeding conſolation of the S. himſelf, but of that Religious too;) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being conſtrained to reſtore his pretious burthen to his Mothers arme agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, the viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rauished. At ſight <hi>of</hi> this ſo diuine a miracle, the poore imperfect Religious man was ſo moued &amp; edified, as he threw him ſelf preſently at S.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95:22"/>a perfect Religious man conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat in al vertue and perfection.</p>
            <p>From theſe two examples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults an infallible proofe of this firſt priuiledge, &amp; the B. Virgins exceeding loue to thoſe who hold deare her memory, and employ themſelues for her ſake in works of piety, whilſt they become each day more faithful and feruent in ſeruing her. And theſe are thoſe shee moſt eſpecially doth regard; theſe are thoſe shee moſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly doth protect, neuer abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them (vnleſſe they abandon her) vntil shee hath happily gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her to heauen.

'tis no ſmal one, I grant, to ingratiate ones ſelfe with an earthly Queen; but with the Queen of heauen 'tis the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that can be imagined; an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour not only to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al the greatneſſes of the earth but al wee can receaue from any Saint in heauen.

            <head>THE II. PRIVILEDGE.</head>
            <head type="sub">Js that the B Virgin is moſt liberal, and accuſtomed to beſtovv frequent graces &amp; fauours on her ſeruants.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>OVE that is true &amp; perfect (as daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth) is neuer ſatisfied in che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, and obliging it by guifts and fauours, euen to diſpoile it ſelfe of al it hath moſt precious, to giue vnto it. So, Ionatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s loue to Dauid was ſo great, as the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſayes of him: Ionathan lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him as his very ſoule; he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95:24"/>pluck't off his richer garments &amp; gaue to him; &amp; to paint his freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip forth in more liuely colours it adds: He gaue him euen his ſword, his cincture; and his bow. Now if worldly loue hath ſuch force ouer the harts of men, what hath the diuine ouer the harts of the Saints in heauen, eſpecially of the B. Virgin, who excels al men and Saints together in the perfection of loue? Let vs vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly ſaye and acknowledge then, that ſhee is ſo affectionat to thoſe who honour her, as ſhee neuer ceaſeth ſhowring on them the heauenly deaw of the moſt pretious guifts and richeſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures there; for which reaſon ſhe is deſeruedly ſtiled by our holy Doctours, the Treaſureſſe of al the riches in heauen, and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatrix
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95:24"/>of al the guifts of God: A dignitie to which his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie hath exalted her in heauen; an honour to which aboue al his ſubiects he hath preferred her. The keyes of euerlaſting riches are in her hands, the coffers of Paradiſe ful fraught with diuine treaſures are at her command, of which shee is nothing ſparing; but liberally giues to al that wil, to al that aske, to al that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend leaſt right vnto them; ſhee being moſt riche and powerful, and her wil equaling her power both in heauen and earth.</p>
            <p>To you al power is giuen (ſayes the mellifluous Doctor deuoutly diſcourſing with her): both in heauen and earth, ſo as you haue ability to do what you wil, and ſo her ſelfe auowes how riche she
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95:25"/>is in diuine treaſures where ſhee ſayes: The grace is in mee of al way and truth, in mee al hope of vertue and of life. And knowing how much they import vs, her ſelfe inuites vs to demand them of her: Come to mee al, ſayes shee, who are deſirous of mee, and be replenish't with my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. See how ready our ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che celeſtial Miſtris is, to make vs participant of her celeſtial ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſee how much she af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects our good, who offers vs ſo bountiouſly thoſe goods and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as are neither beholding to Time, nor fortune. Why doe wee tarry then? why are wee then ſo ſlow, why shake wee not off this dulnes that poſſeſſes vs? doe wee feare perhaps a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful repulſe from her? a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95:25"/>acceſſe? a faſtidious regard? ah no, shee is ſo farr from it, as shee is very ſweetnes, meeknes it ſelfe, and there is nothing, in earth or heauen more affable, more courteous, then shee; as S. Bernard teſtifies of her, where he ſayes. What humane fragilitie is it, that feares to approch &amp; haue acceſſe to the Virgin Mary, in whom is nothing auſtere or terrible, but shee is al humanitie, al ful of charitie and curteſie towards al.</p>
            <p>Let vs then with the common opinion of Doctors hold for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that whoſoeuer hath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to her in their neceſſityes, and duly implore her ayde, are neuer by her fruſtrated of their hopes. O ſweet Lady (ſays the ancient Theophylact) you are a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95:26"/>powerful protectrix of man; for O immaculat Virgin, who euer plac't his hope in you, and was confounded, or who amongſt men, hath implor'd your clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and been abandoned?</p>
            <p>Free then from doubt and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the truth, let vs haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in our neceſſities to this moſt powerful and pittiful Lady, and make our ſelues worthy of thoſe high fauours and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues ſhee ſo bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiouſly rewards her faithful ſeruants. Withal ſhee is, as wee haue ſayd, the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe and diſpenſatrix of al the guifts of God; ſhee is the neck (ſayd S. Hierom) by which our Sauiour who is the head, infuſes into his body the Church al that ſpiritual ſenſe and motion, by 'tis animated and ſuſtained; shee is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95:26"/>the body of the tree by which the roote imparts life vnto the boughs, producing flowers, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, fruit, and al that in the tree excels either for orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or vſe; Shee is the Concaue of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine which firſt receaues plenty of its liuing waters of grace, and after diſtributs them to ſeueral pipes according to their ſeueral capacities. Wherefore S. Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture moſt maturely ſayes: it is wonderful what a collection there is in the Virgin of al the pleintines of grace, &amp; how from thence it is deriued to others, as from its proper ſource ſo aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly as S. Bernard affirmes, al the Citizens of heauen, al the men in the world, al the ſouies in Purgatory, nay euen in Hel it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, do homage to her as to their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95:27"/>ſoueraigne Lady, bowing their knees before her in ſubmiſſiue &amp; beſeeming reuerence. So there is no profeſſion nor eſtate, but is ſubordinate to her, eſpecially Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious the glory and richeſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the Church, which is euer ſheltered vnder the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of her wings, whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders haue in particular ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner ſtil been deuout vnto her, by which meanes they haue obtained for them and their ſpiritual children particular fauours ſtil.</p>
            <p>Who is not aſtoniſh't at the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable loue of that great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triark Saint Dominick to the B. Virgin from whom next to God, his Order acknowledges a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and to haue receaued al its luſtre and conſeruation. For what remarkable graces and fauours
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95:27"/>hath he not receaued by her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion? Of this loue vnto her ſeruice, although there were no other proofe, yet that of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of the Roſary were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
            <p>For how manie thouſand ſorts may we imagine hath this holy Saint led by this excellent deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the honour and ſeruice of the Queen of heauen? how many Princes and Monarkes of the world, how many Queens and Ladyes of worth &amp; honour, how many of al ſorts and profeſſions, euen whole people and whole worlds, (as witnes the new World Antipodes to ours?) neither can we paſſe in ſilence the ſurpaſſing affection S. Francis bare to her, which was ſo great, as he would often in amorous paſsion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95:28"/>verſes to her praiſe, and either ſing them himſelfe, or cauſe them to be ſunge by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. From whence it came, that he ſtil obtaine'd whatſoeuer fauour he demanded of Alm: God, for himſelfe in particular, or his Order in general, by the interceſsion of this beloued Virgin.</p>
            <p>One amongſt the reſt for its raritie I cannot but recount, and it is one of the greateſt and moſt ſtupe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dious miracles of the world, by which ſuch an infinity of ſoules haue been deliuered and dayly are from the very torments and paines of Hel it ſelfe; And this is that great and admirable Indulgence granted at the requeſt of S.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95:28"/>Virgin and innumerable bleſſed ſpirits, to the Church of Aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium commonly cal'd Our Lady of Portiuncula; which by reaſon al Chriſtendome is ſo much taken with the deuotion, as alſo it being ful of rare myſterie and worthy of general notice, we wil breifly make you the narra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of.</p>
            <p>S. Francis once feruently pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſaluation of ſoules, an Angel appeared to him and ſummon'd him to the Church, where it ſaid our B. Sauiour and his mother, with a world of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were expecting him. At this, he ran thither, where, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued he ſaw our B. Sauiour ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the high Altar. in a maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtike ſeate, accompanied by his Mother, and incircled by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuds
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95:29"/>of Angels; When falling proſtrat at his feete, he was ſoone excitated by this comfortable voice of his moſt gratious Lord: Know, Francis, thy praiers are arriued vnto mine eares, and for that I know the affection and ſolicitud of you and your Order for the ſaluation of ſoules, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of me what grace you pleaſe for their avayle, and I wil grant it you. S. Francis at firſt al trembling at ſight of ſuch a maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, by the ſweetnes of theſe words ſecur'd at laſt waighing the importance of them, thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: O Lord, not but that I am conſcious of my great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines to obtayne any grace from you, much-leſſe ſo great an one, but that you are pleaſed to add this to the number of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95:29"/>obligations beſides; I accept your gratious offer, and humbly beſeech of you for the good of euery Chriſtian; that al who viſit this Church, hauing firſt duely confeſt and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat; may obtaine a plenary pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Indulgence of al their ſins: And you O glorious Virgin and gracious aduocatrix of euery Chriſtian, I beſeech you ioyne your powerful interceſſion with my Petition for it; when in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currency with it, conuerting her ſelfe towards her B. Sonne she ſayd: My deereſt ſonne, whom I once had the honour to beare in this wombe of mine, grant I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you this his petition to your faithful ſeruants, ſince the ſaluation of ſoules (then which there is nothing you more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95:30"/>is ſo much concern'd in it. Grant it to my Temple heer, to your honour and the edification of your holie Church. When his diuine Maieſtie caſting a gratious eye towards S. Francis there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat before his throne, ſaye vnto him: Francis, though what thou demand'ſt be much, yet thy deſire merits much more, in being ſo conforme to mine; wherefore I grant thee the Indulgence thou deſireſt, with this condition that thou haue recourſe vnto my ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Vicar, who hath the free diſpoſe to bind and looſe al heer on earth, and of him demand from mee the grant of it. So the viſion vanished; when early the next day S. Francis tooke his iourney towards Perugia where Pope Honorius then reſided with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95:30"/>the Court of Rome; and there humbly kiſſing his feete he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared how al had paſt, and the occaſion of his comming there. At hearing of which, the Pope granted him a Plenary Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence (in manner afore ſayd) for one day in the yeare, though as yet what day in the yeare, was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined, it hauing neither been preſixed by his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie nor his Holines, vntil al laſt vpon this occaſion:</p>
            <p>S. Francis returned to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, was once at mid-night in deepe contemplation in his Cel, when the Angel of darknes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in shape and voice appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him like an Angel of light, and ſaid: Poore Francis, why are you ſuch a Tirant to your ſelfe? why wil you deſtroy nature with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95:31"/>your ſuperfluous watchings thus? Do not you know the night was ordain'd for man to reſt, and that ſleep is the principal ſtay and ſupport of life? Alaſſe, you are yet in the April of your yeares, haue a care then of your ſelf &amp; be ruled by me, if not for your owne ſake, at leaſt for your Orders, whoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety wholy depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds on yours; you are of a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; robuſtious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion promiſing a long life, if you shorten it not by your indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret auſterityes, beleeue it, theſe extrauagant deuotions are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly diſpleaſing to Alm: God, who in al things is moſt delighted with mediocritie. The Saint hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, and by this diſcouering the malice of the wicked Enemie to delude him by a falſe ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuddainly, ſtarted vp, and al naked
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95:31"/>ran to the adioyning wood, where he ſo long rowled him ſelf amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the sharpe thornes &amp; briſty thiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les til the bloud iſſued amaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery part of him; when in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery of his body, now (ſaid he) had it not been better for you, to haue attended ſtil to the ſuffrings of your God, then to ſuffer this, for attending to the Enemy.</p>
            <p>He had no ſooner vtter'd this, but inſtantly behold a cleer light ſpred it-ſelf ouer al the wood, and chaſing darknes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; on the one ſide he ſaw the ground al icye (for it was in the hart of winter) and on the other cloſe by the thornes (he embrewed in his bloud) the white and red roſe freshly ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whilſt the Angels in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuds made a lane for him from that place vnto the Church, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95:32"/>a plenary Indulgence, in that manner (as I deſired it) now my petition is, you would appoint a certaine day for the obtaining of it, and this for your moſt deare and gratious Mothers ſake: Our B. Sauiour thus anſwered him. Francis, thy deſerts are ſuch I can deny thee nothing, wherfore I grant thee thy petition, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the firſt of Auguſt to be it; then the Saint rendring him al poſſible thankes replied; but how, O Lord, ſhal this bee divulged vnto the world, or on whoſe faith wil they take on truſt ſo great a miracle: For that (ſaid our Bl. Sauiour) be it my care to prouide, in the meane while haue you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe againe to my Vicar heer on earth, carrying with you eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this apparition one of your

In this amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſweet, and admirable manner was granted to Holy S. Francis the famous Indulgence of our Lady of Portiuncula, by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraige Monarch of Heauen and earth, a grace ſo great, a fauour ſo ſublime, as neuer was heard of, neuer mortal man receaued the like. By which, and the fore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Inſtitution of the Roſary by the great Patriarch Saint Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick, wherby his Order hath been ſo much ennobled, may cleerly be perceiued, how extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily this bountious Ladye recompences them, who ſerue her affectionally and faithfully.</p>

But ſee Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens inſtice, which comes with the greater force vpon vs, the greater turne it makes ear it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes at vs. He raigned ſome yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res thus, in his wickednes, til at laſt it was his fortune to be taken and deliuered vp bound hand and foot to the publick Magiſtrate by them to priſon, where the ſame day he was condemned to die; of this hauing ſecret intelligence; (ſtrait as if the maſke of his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes were but then taken off) he began to perceaue the vglines of it, ſo as to deteſt it, be wayle and curſe his fortune, and euen waxe deſperat for the greefe and ſhame it had brought vpon himſelf and his family. When behold while
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95:38"/>he was in this diſpoſe of minde, there entred dungeon a man of mightie ſtature and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible aſpect, who addreſſing himſelfe vnto him, Offered, if he would be ru'ld by him, to free him thence; and who are you (ſayd he) almoſt freed by his promiſe from the feare of his apparance, I am the diuel (ſayd he) ſent hither by my Prince to deliuer you; obey but his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; at hearing this, without any long delay, the priſoner (as it is ordinary with wicked men, to preferr the ſafety of their bodyes before their ſoules,) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; What-ſo'ere you are, you wil oblige me by ſo great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to what ſoeuer you demand; then firſt (ſaid the diuel) you muſt renounce Ieſus Chriſt, his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95:38"/>merits; and al the principality he hath ouer you; I doe (ſayd he) and it ſuffices to haue found a Prince of your Maiſter ſo ready, to pleaſure me; next you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce al the Sacraments &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with his Church: and that too, anſwered he. Then to Mary his mother, and al your hope of fauour and aſsiſtance from her; at this he demurr'd, and entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf call'd al his thoughts together in conſult of what he had promiſed his Mother, &amp; what he had performed til then; when reſolued at laſt he anſwered? that he would neuer doe, farr be it from me (ſayd he) how neere ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my life be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cern'd in it, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch an affront to my deare Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſſe, and ſo to iniure her who ſo hath obliged me: No, rather I
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95:39"/>offer her my ſelf (if ſhe daine to accept it) whether ſhe would haue me liue or die, to be wholy and abſolutly at her diſpoſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with this his reſolution, the diuel vaniſhed, when he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto the quick with a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for his hainous offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Lord &amp; Sauiour, at firſt began to weep &amp; ſigh moſt bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then had his recourſe to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary refuge of ſinners the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God ſaying vnto her with a ſobbing voice, a thouſand times interrupted by his greefe: O moſt ſacred Mother of mercy, haue pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on me miſerable ſinner, and do not quite reiect me from before your ſight; I aſke not of you deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from my bonds, I beg not of you to ſaue my life, for that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95:40"/>ſo reformed a man, as he became as remarkable afterwards for goodnes and vertue, as he had been before for vice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
            <p>From this Hiſtory we may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the Mother of God is neuer wanting to her ſeruants in their neceſſities, that ſhe is our refuge, our ſafegard, our comfort, &amp; remedy of al our paines, greefs and afflictions; for which reaſon S. German Patriarch of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinoble vſes theſe words ſpeaking vnto her: There is none ſaued without you (ſayes he) O Bleſſed Virgin, none deliuered from their greeua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces but by you, none but by your mediation receaues any guift from God, none but at your ſuite obtaynes forgiuenes of their ſinnes; O Virgin worthy of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95:41"/>al glory and praiſe, who next to your ſonne takes ſuch an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care of humane kind, as you; who defends them more affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly then you? who ſuccours them more readily then you, when they are aſſalted by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? who extenuats their faults with greater charitie? excuſes them to God, and exempts them from punishment due to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (in continuation of his diſcourſe) ſayes this holy Patriarch; Let the afflicted haue recourſe to you, let thoſe who are loſt vpon the Sea of this worlds miſery in danger to be wrack't, looke towards you as to their Pole-ſtarr, that shal ſafely direct you to their Port. Thus this pious Saint; By which, and that which

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95:44"/>(as S.

            <p>Now to declare vnto the ful, the B. Virgins authority with her ſonne, not Only exceeds my capacitie; but the capacities of al men and Angels. Wherefore let it ſuffiſe to ſay (leaſt in offering at more we ſhould incurr but the repute of preſumption) that she is Mother of God; from whence by Conſequence we may gather that she is of vnlimited power with him, and that the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of her deſire carryes with

And ſo the holye Church deſires no more of her but, <hi>Monſtra te eſſe matrem;</hi> shew thy ſelfe a Mother; And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prayer we ſaye: Grant he may eare our prayers, who Was borne for vs, and daigned to be thine. So in our ordinary litanies we ſupplicats her thrice to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for vs, as one who hath more power and authority, with the Bleſſed Trinity, then al the other ſaints. S. Gregory of Nicomedia in his Sermons to her prayſe, cals her Omnipotent in her aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; And S.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95:45"/>al Power in this world and the next, euen to be able to afford the moſt deſperat a ful aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their ſaluation; for the Omnipotent taking flesh of you, how can you be leſſe then omnipotent with him? and in continuation of his diſcourſe he ſayes; you approch, O Powerful Lady, to the Altar of our humane reconciliation, not in ſuppliant wiſe as do the other Saints, but with the authority of a Mother to a ſonne, which is but to aske and haue.</p>
            <p>Touching the ſecond Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Capacity of the charge in rightly vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our neceſſityes, beſides that she is ſtiled the Mother of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and our Aduocat, both,

            <p>In the Citty of Marcels there ws a deuout Virgin endow'd with al Saintly vertues: who on a certaine day being preſent at Compline in the Church of the Dominicans, while they were ſinging the accuſtomed Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, <hi>Salue Regina,</hi> was rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in extaſy, during which she ſawe fower things of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular remarke: The firſt, that when they pronounced theſe wordes: <hi>Spes noſtra ſalue;</hi> hayle our hope; the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with a gratious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95:46"/>returned them their ſalutation: The ſecond, that at theſe word; <hi>Eia ergo aduocata no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra:</hi> O therfore thou our Aduoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te with a lowly inclination to her B. Sonne she ſeemed to intercede for them: The third, that at theſe wordes: <hi>Illos tuos miſericordes ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los ad nos Conuerte:</hi> Behold vs with thoſe merciful eyes of thine: she caſt vpon them a moſt deare and ſweet regard: And the fourth theſe words: <hi>Et Ieſum benedictum fructum ventris tui nobis poſt hoc exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium oſtende:</hi> and shew vs herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fter Ieſus the bleſſed fruit of your wombe: she by turnes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him there preſent in her armes to al the Religious: This viſion, returning from her extaſy, ſhe declared to her Confeſſor, a man both holy, learned, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95:46"/>with great feeling of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and temdernes. Which example may moue vs, often to haue recourſe vnto this our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Aduocate, ſupplicating her by this deuout Antiphon of hers, in which she ſeemes to take ſoe much delight and complacence.</p>
            <p>The third Condition requiſit in a good Aduocate, is faithfully to acquit them of their charge; &amp; it is impoſſible for vs to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how faithfully and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Mother of God nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiats for vs our affaires in heauen, or to conceaue the admirable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof. So as ſhee hath al theſe requiſite parts of a good Aduocate. Mary wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts not power (ſayes the deuout S.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95:47"/>is the Mother of Wiſdome; nor the will to employ her ſelf to the vttermoſt in our affaires, for ſhe is the Mother of mercy. To which laſt, in being our Aduocat, ſhe is (in manner) bound; For ſo the Iuriſts hold they are bound, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to negotiat the cauſe they vndertake. Beſides being ſo good as ſhe is, &amp; ſo affectionat towards vs, how is it poſsible ſhee ſhould not take to hart an affaire of ſuch conſequence as is that of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; and aboue al, being our Mother too, as wel as his, to w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hom ſhe interceds for vs: a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge circumſtance that ſhe should be both Mother of the King, and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the Iudge and Criminal, of God and Man; which muſt needs render her much concern'd in the affaire to make an attonement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95:47"/>God and vs; and (as S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, ſayes) be euen impatient til she haue performed it. In being our Aduocat then we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her inceſſantly pacifying her ſonns anger towards vs, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diating a reconcilement for al thoſe, who haue recourſe vnto her and implore her aſsiſtance: which may be clearly perceaued from this following Example re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by Iohn Grithi of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Minorits.</p>
            <p>There was (ſayes he) a ſouldier, a man of moſt wicked life, and violater of al things ſacred and prophane: whoſe wife not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (a holy and pious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) had obtain'd of him, by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vowe to faſt in honour of the B. Virgin euery Saturday, &amp; ſaye an <hi>Aue Mary</hi> as ofte as he
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95:48"/>beheld her picture which he did, nor euer omitted to doe. One day, (more to a voyd the vehement heat abrode, then for any heate of deuotion he had within) he entred the Church: where behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an Image of the B. Virgin, he began to doe as he was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. When behold, he had an apparition of our B. Lady on the Altar holding in her armes her B. ſonne al couered ouer with wounds and the abundance of bloud that iſſued out of them: Moued to pitty at the ſight of ſo pittiful a ſpectacle, the Souldier (diuinely inſpired) drew nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and had the boldnes to aske our B. Lady who had ſo wounded her B. ſonne? Thou, and ſuche ſinners as thy ſelfe, (replyed she with an angry countenance)
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95:48"/>who exerciſe more cruelty on him with your daylye crimes, then euer the barbarous Iewes who crucified him. Theſe words ſtruck the Soldyer into ſo liuely repentance for his ſinnes, as he replyed with a ſorrowful hart &amp; weeping eyes: O B. Ladye, it is true indeed, I haue been as great a ſinner as you affirme; yet do but obtaine for me of your B. ſonne a ful pardon and remiſsion of what is paſt, and I heer vow vnto you to be as obſequious he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter to him, as I haue been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious heretofore,</p>
            <p>No, ſayd the B. Virgin, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to heare you no more, nor be any more deceiued by you; for whilſt you ſinners cal me the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercy, you make me with your ſinnes the Mother of al greef
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95:49"/>and affliction: Oh B. Lady (ſayd he) be not ſo inexorable I beſeech you to my prayers, but remember you are the Aduocat of ſinners, and haue (in a manner) contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it, an obligation to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for them, and conſequently for me the moſt greeuous of them al, and moſt needing your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion: Heer the B. Virgin mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to pitty with his words, caſt a pittiful eye towards her ſonne &amp; ſayd: Pardon then I beſeech you, O my ſonne, this poore ſinner who ſo humbly petitions you; no, ſayd the ſacred Infant, his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are too great to be forgiuen; but she perſiſting ſtil to coniure him by al the charmes she thought moſt powerful to moue him; at laſt ſeeing his anger ſo reſolutly bent nothing would moue it, she
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95:49"/>aroſe and placing him on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar went downe ready to caſt her ſelfe vpon her knees before him; which when her B. Sonne beheld, ſuſpecting her intention, he ask't her what she meant to doe? why, ſaye she, to caſt my ſelfe heer proſtrate at your feete, and neuer riſe til you haue granted me my petition; O mother, ſay the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der Infant, you know the force your wil hath with mine; For your ſake, I pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this wicked wretche and in lieu of ſatifaction admit him, to kiſſe my wounde; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged al this by the B. Virgin, the ſoldier drew neere, and whil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with incredible Conſolation, he kiſt wound after wound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, vnder the touch of his mouth they al heald vpp. The B. Infant thus recouering, the viſion va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95:50"/>when the ſoldier pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently hauing home; diſtributed al his goods vnto the poore, and then by common conſent, he and his wife ſeparated, and entred into Religion. O happy ſoules the while, and happy Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which I would to God al ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would imitate. To cunclude then, ſince we haue ſo powerful an Aduocate in heauen of the B. Virgin; let vs make no delay but preferr our ſupplications to her, expoſe our neceſsityes, and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her for a redreſſe of them; the meane while, more to inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt her in our affaires, let vs be aſſiduous in honouring her, and ingenious in finding out the way to do it beſt, omitting neither day nor night to ſalute her with humble reuerence, alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring

            <p>Let vs Confirme this verity by the example of a common Curtezen conuerted by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of our B. Lady. We reade in the great Marial, of a lewd wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wholly abandoned to vice
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95:52"/>and licentiouſnes; who not with ſtanding neuer omitted dayly ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen times to bow downe in reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the B. Virgin, and to ſay an <hi>Aue Maria</hi> in honour of her; Now amongſt her frequent proſtitutions, it happened one of principal quality haunted her company, whoſe wife being a vertuous Lady and one ſingularly deuoted to the Queene of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; did beare her huſbands il demeanour ſo impatiently, as one day proſtrating her ſelfe before an Image of the B. Virgin she ſayd: O moſt ſoueraine Lady, mirrour of al purity, how can you ſuffer this, to ſee one ſo sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefully abuſed, and an impudent woman thus glory in my iniury? I beſeech you punish her ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarly, that she may be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95:52"/>warning hereafter for al the reſt; Grant this requeſt O ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraine Lady, if not vnto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of my prayers, and heate of my ſeruices, Yet at leaſt to the pitty of my Cauſe, and the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerables of my iniurye. When behold a wonder, the Image thus anſwered her; deare ſeruant, it is impoſſible for me to ſatisfie your deſire, I know your wrongs and the iuſt cauſe you haue to be offended at them; but know whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, she is ſo deuout to me, in midſt of al her wickednes, as I cannot proceed againſt her as you deſire; only this I wil doe, for your comfort, I wil petition my Sonne for her, that he would turne her hart, and that she may turne vnto amendment; which was done, for within few dayes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95:53"/>after there happened a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Change in both the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, both he and she refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their liues, and liuing chaſtly &amp; exemplarly euer after. And is not this a rare priuiledge then, of thoſe deuoted to the Queene of Heauen, that let them be neuer ſo deeply plunged in the abyſſe of ſins, yet she can deliuer them thence? I cal it a priuiledge, ſince for their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deuotion to the Queene of Heauen they are particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the law of other finners.</p>
            <p>This affectionat deuotion beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to the B. Virgin is a probable and experimented ſigne of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, I ſay only a probable one, becauſe 'tis true, none kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes whether they be worthy of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95:53"/>loue or hate, and an infallible one in this life there is none.</p>
            <p>With what contented harts then should we liue, did we but exerciſe our ſelues, in good works and frequent acts of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the B. Virgin? and what hope of eternal felicity should our minds be rayſed vnto free from al thoſe doubts and feares of their ſaluation, which thoſe who walke not in the way of God and the ſeruice of his B. Mother, do meet withal ſo often? And from hence proceeded the firme Confidence of Saints, grounded on the knowledge they had of the exceſſiue liberality &amp; promiſes of Alm; God, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer as it were the Kingdome of heauen by the force of Chriſts merits and their owne coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95:54"/>by which they were ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in the midſt of their moſt greeuous ſufferances, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could daunt or diſcourage them.</p>
            <p>S. Bernard in his ſermons on Septuageſima ſayd, that although 'tis true no man knowes for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whether he be in the grace of God or no, ſince in this life no man hath an infallible knowledge of his ſaluation; Yet (ſayes he,) (and 'tis a ſaying of vnſpeakable comfort thoſe who are perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in good) we are not to be diſanimated, nor giue ouer the working of our ſaluation with an anxious feare, ſince we haue for our comfort a hope of it ariſing from ſo many euident ſignes of it, as it ſeldome or neuer decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues our truſt. Heare himſelf: le'ts
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95:54"/>neuer trouble our ſelues (ſays he) with any ſuch doubt as this, for we haue ſuch certaine markes &amp; manifeſt arguments of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in thoſe who haue them, there is no doubt at al.</p>
            <p>The Example of S. Hilarion comes wel to the Confirmation of this; drawing towards his end, and being affrighted with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of death in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner encouraged himſelf; Go out my ſoule, ſaid he, What feareſt thou? 'tis ſeauenty yeares ſince thou begon'ſt to ſerue thy God, and now art a feard of death? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what an aſſurance and firme hope of ſaluation a vertuous life can giue to the ſeruants of God, and how cleere and euident the markes are of eternal ſaluation to thoſe who liue vertuouſly. Let
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95:55"/>euery Chriſtian then endeauour to liue ſo, and he shal feele in himſelfe the contentment of this ſecurity, which is ſo great, as it exceeds al the other Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we can haue in this mortal life. Which S. Francis wel expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, when hauing had a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, how he was predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be ſaued, through exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue ioy for a long tyme he could vtter nothing elſe, but Bleſſed be God, bleſſed be God. And if theſe ſignes of Predeſtination are to be ſeene in any, in a moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner are they to be ſeene in thoſe who are deuoted to the B. Virgin; which from this following Example wilbe made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>S. Anſelme in his booke of the miracles of our B. Lady, recounts
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95:55"/>this ſtory: how the Diuel (who out of his inueterat hate to man, ſeekes al meanes poſſible to ruine him) once putt himſelfe in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to a noble man, hauing firſt taken on him a humane shape; whoſe humour he knew ſo wel to comply withal, as in short ſpace he had al the care of his family committed to his charge; and purſuing the aduantage he had ouer his wil and his affections, he was ſtill ſuggeſting ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife or other to him, now coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeling him to wrong this man, now to murther that, ſo as no day paſt in which he made him not guilty of ſome notable wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes; now it hapned one day, this noble-man walking in his woods accompanied with his crew of ruffians, encountred with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95:56"/>a certaine holy Preiſt, whom he violently layd hands on and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed priſoner to his Caſtle; at night the Prieſt ſignified to him he had a ſecret to impart vnto him, in which he was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, but it muſt be in preſence of al his ſeruants; the noble-man with a longing deſire to know what it was, aſſembled them al together except this diuel, who retired himſelf, and tooke for an excuſe ſome indiſpoſition of health: the Preiſt by diuine reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation knowing the craft of the wicked enemie, told the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man his preſence was ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among the reſt, as without it, there could be nothing done. How would you haue him come anſwer'd the noble-man, ſince you heare them ſay he cannot
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95:56"/>ſtand on his legs he is ſo ill? All's one for that, replied the Preiſt againe, ſome meanes muſt be found out to bring him heer. The noble-man ſeeing him ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolut, commaunded two of his ſeruants notwithſtanding al his excuſes to ſee him brought, which was don, and he came counterfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſickman vnto the life; when the holy-man before them al, Coniured him preſently in the name of Alm. God to declare who he was, and to what end he had put himſelf in ſeruice to that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-man? At this, the diuel ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting toward him ſuch a looke, was able to make tremble the bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt there, anſwered plainly he was the diuel, and his end of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his Maiſter was, to procure his deſtruction which he had long
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95:57"/>ſince effected, had not the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin interpoſ'd her ſelf: &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſayd the Prieſt? why only for a certaine cuſtome this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wretch had (ſayd he) dayly to ſalute her humbly on his knees ſeauen times both morning and euening, and as oft reherſe in her honour the Angelical ſalutation. Which if I could haue once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to omit, as I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored often, I had preſently kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and taken his ſoule to hel, and hauing vttered this in ſhooting himſelf like lightning out of the roome, he preſently diſ-appeared, with his hideous roaring leauing them al in horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affright, of which the holy man taking his aduantage, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them al to penance and bitter life, and eſpecially the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95:57"/>with whom he prevayled ſo much, as he wholly conuerted him and made him as exemplar in goodnes, as he had been in wickednes.</p>
            <p>By this example we ſee this Priuiledge, and the exceeding value of this interiour and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour reuerence exhibited vnto the Queene of Heauen. And if this hapned vnto one ſo wicked a man as he, how much more ſpecial care wil ſhe haue of al thoſe, who ſerue her in holines and purity of life? with what a Deare tendernes wil ſhe vnder, take the protection of thoſe? and what a watchful eye wil ſhee haue to defend them from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalts of the Enemy?</p>
            <p>Let vs then conclude this holy and profitable exerciſe with our
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95:58"/>duly honouring the B. Virgin both with exterior and interior reuerence affered vpp with al be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming obſequiouſnes; ſo shal we ingratiate our ſelues, with our moſt deare and bountious Lady, by whoſe meanes we shal obtaine that quiet and repoſe of hart, which is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al worldly things.</p>

            <head>The Conditions requiſit in a ſeruant of the B Virgin, and firſt of Humility.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S thoſe who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tettain'd in ſeruice of any earthly Prince to obtaine their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, endeauour to appeare endowed with al thoſe vertuous: parts and qualityes by which they are taken moſt: ſo thoſe who would be fauoured by the Queene of Heauen, muſt whilſt they ſerue her, endeauour to be qualified with thoſe vertues ſhe is cheifly delighted in; which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95:59"/>are principally thoſe ſhe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſ'd her ſelf in, whilſt ſhe was conuerſant in this mortal life, as namely <hi>Humility, Corporal chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and purity of hart,</hi> to which we may add our diligent frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and receauing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the only meanes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vs in internal purity and to begin with humility, which is the foundation of al other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>It is certaine, no other vertue was more perſpicuous in her then that of humility, though she had al the reſt in their higheſt exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and this appeares by the account which she made of it, teſtifyed by theſe words of hers: <hi>Becauſe he hath regarded the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his handmayed: therefore al generations shal call me bleſſed:</hi> as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95:59"/>much as to ſay; that God only in regard of the lowlines of her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, had elected her to that high dignity, of being his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if to be humble of hart (according to S. Dorotheus) is to account abiectly of ones ſelfe and preferr al before them, of what excellency was this vertue in the B. Virgin, who from thoſe words of her, <hi>Becauſe he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the humility of his handmaide;</hi> we may ſuppoſe (as F. Arias wel obſerues) she had ſo humble an opinion of her ſelfe, as she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted her ſelfe of al other creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res the moſt contemptible.</p>
            <p>This vertue then shining ſo reſplendantly in her, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to haue been that, moſt took the eyes of her B. Sonne, &amp; made him ſooneſt choſe her for Mother,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95:60"/>as a ſonne in this world if it lay in his choice would ſooneſt make electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her for mother, whom he ſawe endued with thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and qualities which were moſt in account with vs; and this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to be inferred by theſe words of the text: For he hath beheld the humility of his handmayd; and as if she would ſay; the ſonne of his heauenly Father hath caſt a fauourable eye on me his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruante, and thought me worthy of his loue; not becauſe I am nobly borne, wiſe, prudent, conuerſant in the ſcriptures, and the like; not for any beauty or corporal perfection, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my humility. For ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though al her other vertues were moſt exceeding grateful to Alm. God, yet that of her humility was
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95:60"/>moſt of al, it being as it were the foundation of al the reſt. In ſo much as according to Lyr'as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was in her the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal diſpoſition to the concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the ſonn of God; &amp; ſo ſays S. Hierom. God was rather moued to be incarnat in her womb by her humility then another vertue elſe. In this vertue it was (as S. Mechtild vnderſtood by reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) she ſo exerciſed her ſelf and laboured ſo carefully, as she attei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the height &amp; perfection of it; by this ſhe came to ſo abſolute a knowledge of her ſelf; by this she would leſſen her own proportion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared either vnto God or man. And diſclaiming wholy from her owne deſerts; by this she came to attribute al the fauours ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to the ſole benignity of Alm.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95:61"/>God, and rendred him thanks for them accordingly; by this in fine she came neuer to vtter word in her owne prayſe, or to giue willing eare to others praiſes, neuer to take vain-glory in any thing, but to attribut al the glory to Alm: God, inceſſantly magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyng and praiſing him, with ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring him infinity of thanks for his great fauours towards her; and ſo she begins her Canticle; <hi>My ſoule doth magnifie our Lord, and my ſpirit exults in God my Sauiour.</hi> And to the model of this excellent vertue of hers, are al her deuout ſeruants to conforme their actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and expreſſe the portraiture of it in their ſoules; when how grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wil thy appeare in the eyes of this glorious Queene, when they preſent themſelues before her in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95:61"/>this riche equipage. Certainly there is none hath any vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or diſcourſe in him, that wil not humble himſelfe vnto the ground and thinke him the moſt abiect of al other things, who ſhal but conſider how profoundly humble the B. Virgin was euen in that exalted ſtate of hers of being Mother of God, more holy then the Angels, and more pure then the very ſun-beames them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And who conſidering his owne vilenes and extraction only from a litle earth, his being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ſuch a world of faults and imperfections, his becoming through ſinne enimie to God, and companion of the diuel, wil not in imitation of the B. Virgin caſt themſelues into the bottome of humility, from the topp of pride
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95:62"/>and preſumption, whereon they ſtand</p>
            <p>A great and neere Imitator of this humility of hers, was her great ſeruant S. Francis, who was ambitious of nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſo much on earth, as to be accounted the moſt abiect of al his brethren and for his owne part he eſteemed himſelfe no better then a colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of al the abhominable vices in the world, and one of the moſt greeuous ſinners as euer was; which in one ſo great a Saint and in whom ſo many vertues were aſſembled, was the more rare, and worthy the greater wonder and imitation.</p>
            <p>And although this in general might ſuffice to affect vs to this excellent vertue, yet I wil ſett you downe in particular a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95:62"/>for the attayning it, giuen by B. Tecelam a Religious of the third Order, to a certaine freind of his: who demanding of him by what meanes the vertue of Humility was to be acquired, he anſwered; Contemne thy ſelfe, and al thou haſt in the world; eſteeme euery one more perfect then thy ſelfe; and haue a ſlight opinion of none; make great eſteeme of thy faults, and litle of thy vertues &amp; perfections: count litle al the good thou doſt to others, and the harme thou doſt for great; and thou shalt be in a faire way to Humility. To this we may add S. Bonauentures ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the attayning this holy vertue; Abaſe thy ſelfe as lowly as thou canſt (ſayes he): Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine al men thy betters, and thy
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95:63"/>ſelfe hardly worthy to be their? ſlaue, and ſo thou shalt arriue to a tranquillity of mind, and neuer be moleſted with offence or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to impatience. By which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent documents we may learn to find out true humility and the wayes that lead vnto, a Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſo profitable for our ſoules which our B. Sauionr perſwads vs to vndertake ſaying: Learne of me to be meeke and humble of hart. And thoſe ſeruants of the B. Virgin: who are ſo indeed, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially women-kind are to shew it in their exterior comportments as they goe abrode in publique, shewing neither pride nor vanity in their lookes nor apparel, and compaſing both according to the exact rules of vertue and decency For what an vnworthy thing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95:63"/>were it in them, to appeare in the B. Virgins ſight leſſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly adorn'd or decently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued, things which she in her ſelfe ſo much abhorr'd as S. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius teſtifies of her together with diuers others, that her owne habit was euer plaine and ſimple without al affectation of riches or novelty, and (which is an euident ſigne of her owne purity (neuer ſubiect to any ſpott or ſtayne, but ſtil the more whit (as it wer) for her wearing it, This humility in their habits then let women learne of her, euen for the loue of our B.

Surius in the life of S.

She (ſays he) one day at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in her Maieſtick robes in al her pompe and brauery entred the Church, where beholding iuſt at the entrance a Crucifix, ſhe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly made a ſtand, and in great bitternes and compunction of hart, began in this manner to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into compariſon of her ſelf with it; Shal, my Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, remaine al naked nayled to this hard Croſſe, &amp; ſhal I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſinner as I am, go at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure veſted in theſe coſtly robes, curiouſly embrodered with gold and precious ſtone?

O my Ieſus, shal I ſee thee, the only Spouſe of my hart, haue thy head tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearc't with thoſe ſharp thornes; &amp; ſhal I with ſuch magnificence weare a crowne on mine? Alas, and can I behold him abandoned by al his freinds, and inhumane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left for a prey, to the outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vſage of his enemies, and ſett vp as a marke for them to ſhoote their horrible blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at; whilſt I my ſelf go with ſo great a trayne, wayted vpon and honoured at euery turne? O miſerable, moſt miſerable as I am, is this the loue I beare to my Sauiour Chriſt, are theſe my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and gratitud for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95:65"/>al his benefits? And in ſaying this a ſodaine palenes, ouercaſt her face, and a greeuous fainting caſt her in a trance: when returning out of it, ſhe firmely purpoſed neuer to admit of ſuperfluity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in any thing ſhe wore, <hi>&amp; de facto</hi> euer after she went ſo mortified in her apparrel, as moſt commonly she had vnder it a rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hayre cloth, and as often as the Dukes occaſions abſented him from her, she would be ſo courſly attired, as no poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man but went better clad.</p>
            <p>And certainly it is a deplorable thing euer with teares of bloud, to ſee what exceſſe of apparel &amp; voluptuouſnes raignes amongſt women now a dayes, ſo as they ſeeme to place al their their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city (as it were) in a newfangled
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95:65"/>fashion or attire. I would they knew or conſidered how diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it is to Alm: God, or how many ſoules their vaine curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and foolish pride haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated and caſt downe to Hel, and what lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table harmes haue had their origin from thence; for they are not only the cauſe of their owne ſinnes, but alſo of others participation with them, whilſt in regarding them the bayte hath been but layd by the Enemy to draw thouſands vnto hel. Which perhapps we should hardly Credit, did not the holy Ghoſt it ſelfe affirme it: Turne away thy face (ſayes he) from a woman Curioſity adorned, for many haue been taken by the beauty of women, and become reprobate; a horrible thing to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95:66"/>imagination. And how many Religious men haue we ſeene drawne by the attraction of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, firſt to inſinuat themſelues into their familiarityes vnder the pretence of ſanctity and ſpiritual conuerſe, and after by degrees ſo deeply engaged in their ſocieties, as without hazard of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they haue neuer been able to get out.

But happy is the ſoule the whilſt that reiects theſe vaine feares, in a matter in which their ſaluation is ſo much concern'd, and preferr their ſoules immortal good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al other humane reſpects.

            <p>A Religious man of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of Sicily, praying one day in the Church of his Conuent, had the apparition of a woman al naked preſented before his eyes, whom he coniuring in the name
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95:67"/>of God, to declare vnto him what she was, she anſwered with great shame and confuſion; I was (ſaid she a woman of fashion and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in my dayes, and of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fortune, al which I abuſed ſo, to his offence who gaue it me, as in al my life I had no other thought, than how to adorne me in moſt curious manner, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtill the faſhions of the time, till coming to die it, was God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightyes mercy to me, I ſhould repent me of my ſinns, and with true Contrition make an entire Confeſſion of them, by which meanes I had them al forgiuen me on this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition that I should for penance of my former vanity, off attire, wander in this manner naked vp and downe the world; and hauing ſayd this, she diſ-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95:67"/>Where is to be noted, that although the poore ſoule for its greater Confuſion imagined she was a ſpectacle to al, yet none ſaw her but thoſe whom God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie pleaſ'd to reueale this his ſecret iudgement vnto, in whom it excited rather a holy feare of the ſeuere punishments of Alm. God, then any vnlawful imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or deſire.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe then who deſire to render themſelues acceptable in the eyes of the B. Virgin endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with al their might to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come humble both in the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour &amp; exteriour humility being the only vertue on which God beſtowes his moſt aboundant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. God reſiſts the proud (ſays the holy Scripture) and giues his grace to the humble. And the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95:68"/>moſt ſure and infallible way to heauen is true Humility. Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (ſays S. Auguſtin) is the Queene of vertues, the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vice, the mirrour of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and the throne of the holy Trinity.</p>
            <p>In fine, humility is that, which beſt teaches vs both to Know the deceipts of the diuel, &amp; to auoyd them, being knowne; as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueal'd to S. Anthony, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding one day in viſion al the world ſett with ſnares about, he cried out; O Lord, how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for one to eſcape al theſe? and he was anſwered by a voice from heauen; by being humble, Anthony; for onely Humility ſtoopes ſo low, 'tis neuer entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled by them. And ſo we reade, how the diuel once appear'd to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95:68"/>S. Macarius with a mightie ſcithe in his hand, threatening him as if he would haue mowed him off, &amp; crying out againſt him; O Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius, what a cruel ſtrife is there betwixt vs two, and yet how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it is for me to ouercome thee: I do al that thou doeſt and more, for thou watcheſt ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and I neuer ſleepe; ſomety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes thou faſteſt but I neuer eate; I thinke as obiectly, and ſett as light as by the worlds vanityes as thou; only one thing there is in which thou ſurmounteſt me, which is that profound humility of thine. We ſee then, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable force this Chriſtian Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility hath, to ouerthrow pride, and triumphe ouer the ſtratagems and forces of the Enemy; a force ſo great, as the very mention of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95:69"/>it is enough to put al the armies of Hel to flight; which I wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme by an example taken out of the Frier Minors Chronicle, and it is this.</p>
            <p>In the Conuent of Peruſia the Prouince, where S. Francis was borne, there was a Guardian of an auſtere life, endowed with al the vertues of a good Religious man; now it happened that a noble man of the Countrey on Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-Eue ſent an expreſſe meſſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to deſire him to ſend one of his Religious the next day to ſay Maſſe for him, and it hapned iuſt at the inſtant that two of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious returning from a long iourney, weary with trauayling and almoſt dead with cold and hunger, he preſently commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to ſatisfie the deſire of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95:69"/>the Noble-man; which they as preſently vndertake without once murmuring and repyning at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund or alleadging for their excuſes their great neceſſities; Going then with great humility and obedience, behold they were ſcarce halfe way on their iourney, but they were ouertaken by night and involued in ſo thicke a darck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that they could not ſee their way; which incommodity ioyned to that of their hunger and cold, made their caſe the more commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable; when ſeeing themſelues ſo deſtitut of al humane helpe, they had their ordinary recourſe to the diuine helpe beſeeching Almighty God, to ſuccour them in their ſo great neceſſitie, and in the meane time going on, though whether right or no they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95:70"/>could not tel; at laſt they hard the ringing of a Bell, and their eares directing their ſteps, at laſt they arriued at a Monaſtery (as it ſeem'd;) where hauing knockt, the gate was preſently opened, and al the Religious in flock came to ſalute them; from thence they convey'd them to their chamber, where they had al things prepar'd for their reſt &amp; refreſhment with great diligence; At laſt the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious departing from them exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them a promiſe to make them ſome ſhort exhortation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next dayes Matins. Wel, the morning being come, and it ringing to Matins, the Religious were al aſſembled, and one of theſe good Fathers an excellent Preacher began to make them an
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95:70"/>exhortation taking for his text theſe words of the Prophet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaias: A child is borne vnto vs, and a ſonn is giuen vs; on which he diſcourſed moſt diuinely of our Sauiours humility in deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo low to take vpon him our humane nature, and whilſt he was in the heat of his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he might perceiue al the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious one after another ſlinking away till at laſt there was only left the Abbot in the Quire. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al amazed demanding of him the reaſon why his Monkes had left him ſo? your ſelf are the cauſe, ſayd he, how is that poſſible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the good man againe? Why (ſayd the Abbot) you haue diſcourſ't in ſuch manner of I know not what humility of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95:71"/>ſonne of God, as they neither would nor could endure to heare it prayſ'd and extolled ſo much: for to diſcouer the truth vnto you, we are not (as we ſeeme) Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men but diuels, who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of your prompt obedience to your Superiour haue been, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayn'd to giue you that aſſiſtance you haue receiued of vs to night, and hauing, ſayd this, both he &amp; the Monaſtery and al diſ-appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, leauing the good Religious men mightily aſtoniſh't at ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wondrous an accident and in the ſame place where they firſt hard the Bell, from whence they tooke their iourney towards the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, al the way thanking and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying God for his great fauours &amp; benefits beſtowed vpon them.</p>
            <p>Many other examples of this
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95:71"/>great vertue I could recount, and eſpecially that of the B. Virgin, who when the Higheſt had choſen her for his mother profeſt her ſelfe the lowlyeſt of his ſeruants, &amp; in her greateſt honors went in viſitation of S. Elizabeth, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her for three ſpace moneths; then with what greater humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity can be imagined? beſides how lowly did she matche her ſelf, onely to a poore Artificer, to whom she continued dutiful and obedient euen to death, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her ſelfe alwayes with thoſe who were moſt poore and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as we may gather by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage she was preſent at of that poore couple at Cana in Galilee, neither refuſing her company to the moſt greeuous ſinners ſuch as was S. Mary Magdalen and the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95:72"/>like; and al this humility in one, who was exalted to ſo high a dignity, as to be mother of God, and Queene of heauen &amp; earth, was ſo much the more admirable and rare, that she should neuer boaſt her of any honour she had, nor be the more exalted in her mind for being ſo high exalted in dignity; but neither on this nor any other example for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wil I further enlarge my ſelfe, not to exceed the limits of that breuity I haue propoſed to my ſelf.</p>

Humility and Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95:73"/>were ſo equally in this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lady, as to which to giue the pre-eminence we do not knowe; ſo happy was her Virginy in being adorned with ſuch humility, that admitted of no vaine preſumption of it, and ſo happy was her humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in hauing the honour of ſuch virginity, which defended it from al miſpriſion and contempt; and what clearer teſtimony can there be of this holy Virgins immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Chaſtity then theſe words of hers; How can this be, ſeeing I know not man? And of her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility on the other ſide, then thoſe which preſently follow: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the handmayd of our Lord; be it don vnto me according to thy word. O what a mariage was heere of theſe two vertues in the B. Mayd, where chaſtity became
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95:73"/>ſo humble, and humility ſo chaſt? what higher dignity could there bee, then to be Mother of God, and yet she profeſt her ſelfe his humbleſt ſeruant, aba-ſing her ſelfe as low as he had exalted her, ſo as S. Antoninus had iuſt cauſe to ſaye, that it was cheifly the attraction of her humility, which drew the ſonne of God from heauen, to make in her wombe another heauen on death.</p>
            <p>Al then, but cheifly thoſe of her owne ſexe, are to imitate this B. Virgin in her Angelical pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who is propoſed a paterne and example vnto al. It wa's she; that firſt aduanced the ſtandard of Virginity, vnder whoſe white colours ſo many ſince haue fought, and firſt ledd the way, which ſo many Virgine-ſoules
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95:74"/>haue followed ſince, of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theyr virginities vnto God by vowe; in doing which (ſayes S. Anſelme) she ſauoured more of diuine then mortal: neither did the name of Mother any thing derogat from the dignity of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but rather dignified it the more, adding the fruit of a mother to the flower of virginity in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine &amp; admirable manner. Where fore with good reaſon she is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Virgin of Virgins; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a paterne to al the reſt, of Conſecrating their virginityes to God; a work ſo grateful to him and acceptable.</p>
            <p>O happy and thrice happy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, then, who perpetuate their Virginityes by vow vnto Alm. God, in ſpight of al reſiſtance the world doth make; ſeing beſides
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95:74"/>the many prerogatiues they haue aboue thoſe who are wedded to men; they enioy by it ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of mind, as ſurpaſſes al the Comforts in the world.</p>
            <p>In confirmation of which, I wil relate the excellent diſcourſe of Nereus and Achilles to S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitilla in commendation of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity when they perſuaded her to Chriſtianity. Theſe ſeing her curious in adoring her ſelf, tooke occaſion from thence to diſpoſe her minde: Madame (ſayd they) if you were but as ſollicitous to adorne your ſoule with vertues, as you are in ſetting your body of, with theſe ſuperfluous orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to pleaſe your ſpouſe Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, without al doubt you would take the eies of Ieſus Chriſt with it, a farr more noble ſpouſe then
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95:75"/>he, and one who would farr more deſerue of you, with whom you should liue ſtil in an increaſe of beauty: whilſt your other would only liue vpon the ſpoiles and the decayes if it; To whom she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, (yet vnskild in Chriſtian perfection, and one that knew nothing but what the world and flesh dictated vnto her) what can be more happy ſayd she, then the ſtate of mariage, which compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in it al that is of honour and felicity? Alas, Madame, ſaid Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus againe,) you know no more then the vaine pleaſures which vanish with this blaſt of life, and are ignorant as yet (it ſeemes) of thoſe euerlaſting ones in the other life, and waighs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of mariage al if, you putt not its incommodities in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95:75"/>other ſcale, which I would haue you carefully doe, before you looſe, a good can neuer once loſt be recouered againe; And what good is that, ſaye she? your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, anſwered he, which with the litle of Virgin you muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, changing it for a ſeruile eſtate and ſlauish obſequiouſnes vnto one whoſe humors you know not and which perharps may be ſuch, as out of pure Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy he may interdict you the company of your neareſt freinds, and thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you moſt eſteeme, behauing himſelfe ſo harshly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, as no ſlaue but should liue a more contented life then you. Al this, halfe ſmiling she ask't him, whither his general rule had no exception; for (ſayd she) I grant you Iealouſy is a vice but
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95:76"/>too ordinary in men, which my mothers ſad experience renders but too manifeſt, yet is it not ſo fatal to al the kind, but there is ſome ſo happy to be exempted from it, and amongſt the reſt, the excellent diſpoſe of my Aurelian promiſes him to be one. Achilles to this replyed, Madam, (ſaid he) be not to confident, for theſe yong louers in the heat of their pourſuite, the eaſier to attaine to their deſires, diſſemble their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations, and appeare more mild and gentle then they are; but thoſe once attayn'd, off goes the maske of their diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then you shal ſee how iealous they can be, how harsh and croſſe in their diſpoſitions, how iniurious to you in words, and not ſeldone alſo in deeds. But
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95:76"/>ſuppoſe them of a more temperat humour and more gently inclin'd, what priuiledge enioy they by it? If you ſhal giue me leaue, I wil tel you what: To beare a painful burthen in the wombe nine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths together, to waxe leane and pale with it, to be ſubiect to a thouſand languors and diſguifts the while if you haue no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Lord what diſcontents, what repinning at it? If you haue with what danger? and how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in giuing their life do Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers looſe their owne? what care and trouble in their education? What feares leaſt al their labours should be loſt, and death make his harueſt of what they had ſowne with paine? then what diſconforts do they bring their parents with their lewdnes and vntowardnes;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95:77"/>ſome liuing ſo as they wiſh they had neuerben borne; others dying ſo, as they wiſh-they had neuer lived; ſo as both a liue and dead, they ſeeme only borne, for their Parents affliction. At this; Nereus croſſing his armes and lifting vpp his eys like one in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, concluded thus: O happy then the ſtate of virginity which exempts vs from al theſe miſeries and vnites the ſoule that is hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with it, to Alm. God O moſt riche and incomparable treaſure, whoſe poſſeſſion exceeds al eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme, and repaires al loſſe; and O Diuine loue, and more then humane fortitude, by which a weake woman can ſubdue the fleſh, &amp; with a generoſity aboue the weaknes of her ſexe, wage warr with the world, ouercome
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95:77"/>her appetites, and vanquiſh the forces both of death and hel it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for which they ſhal one day enioy a Crowne, with which none in heauen ſhalbe honoured but they. With theſe ſpeeches of her deuout ſeruants, but much more with thoſe which heauen ſpoke to her inward hart, the Lady was ſo moued, as she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conſecrated her Virginity to God, for whoſe loue vnto the palme of Virginity she after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that of Martyrdome.</p>
            <p>Now we are to note, there are three ſorts of Chaſtitys in the Church, by either of which the B. Virgins deuout ſeruants may become grateful vnto her. The firſt is Matrimonial Chaſtity, when man and wife loyally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their Coniugal faith to one
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95:78"/>another: The ſecond is Vidual Chaſtity, when Widowes free from the obſeruance of man, liue afterwards in perpetual continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp; this excels in excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy the firſt degree, as S. Paul ſaies ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of widowes; <hi>Yet they are more happy ſo,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>If you wil Credit me.</hi> The third is Virginal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, more excellent then both the other more perfect and more meritorious; and this is, when we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue our ſelues in our integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of body &amp; mind dedicating our virginities to Alm. God, which, oh, how grateful how acceptable it is to the B. Virgin, who preferrs it before al other oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Seing then al theſe three ſorts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity are with proportion both good and laudable, and with the B. Virgin of pretious eſteeme, let
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95:78"/>thoſe that are deuoted to her, be they maid, widow, or wife, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in their ſeueral degrees, to preſent her with this grateful of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, to which end they are to reſolue to fight manfully, for the Enemies that oppugne it, are both many and powerful, their Arts ful of al ambushes, and their endeauours inceſsa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of vs: ſo as S. Auguſtine conſidering the difficulty of the fight, and rarenes of the victory, with good reaſon ſayd: <hi>Amongſt al the warrs the Christians had, that of Chaſtity was the moſt sharpe, and preſſed vs moſt; where the Combat laſted alwayes, and an entire victory was neuer gott attayned vnto;</hi> and thoſe that naturely ponder it find it true. For but conſider how few they are, that fight it manfully
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95:79"/>indeed, in compare with thoſe who cowardly yeild vnto the Enemy, and we may truely ſaye, the diuel gaines by nothing more then this; for how many of al ages and conditions, of either ſexe, doth the Enemy precipitate into this vice, who for the reſt ſtood firme enough? To which purpoſe S. Auguſtin hath a feareful ſaying: <hi>Excepting Infants</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>this only ſinne is the occaſion that ſo few of the reſt are ſaued.</hi> Who at hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this, is not aſtonished? &amp; conceiues not a pitty of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate, to ſee how head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long al runne vnto this vice. And as for the ſeruants of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, what excuſe can they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for their exceſſes herein? what wayes they to pleaſe her, whilſt they diſpleaſe her heere?
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95:79"/>Do they thinke, that ſaying their beads frequently wil do it? or their faſtings on Saturdayes and the like? Alas, no, they doe but deceiue themſelues, and the vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſuch an honourable title as to be her ſeruants, whilſt they are ſuch? Doth but more encreaſe their damnation, whilſt they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe that name to the diſhonour of Chaſtity by which ought to be cheefly honoured, and while they put on the face of wearing her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, but weare the badge of her Enemy in their harts. Alas, how many may we imagine now in hel, who were once deuoted to the B. Virgin as wel as we, till with a fooliſh preſumption of their ſaluation, they with a deafe eare paſt ouer her ſaving and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſuggeſtions &amp; fel: to which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95:80"/>if wee deſire to be ſaued indeed, we muſt lend an attentiue eare ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing from our harts, al mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſenſuality, and entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning al chaſt ones in their place, or elſe we leeſe her fauour, and it wil be wo with vs.</p>
            <p>But aboue al for conſeruation of our Chaſtity, it is neceſſary to flie al occaſions and inducements to the contrary, for this is ſuch a kinde of victory, as is beſt gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by flight, and they that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expoſe themſelues to daunger in it, are ouercome at laſt. Wherefore let none enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an ouer-wening of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues or their forces for any former vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, for they may eaſily leeſe in a moment what they haue been in an age a getting, and ſlight occaſion may rauish from them
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95:80"/>that, which many difficult ones went to the obtaining of; and let no humane or nice reſpect, make them be wanting heer, to the care they ought to haue of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity; for many out of punctillios of honour haue ſtood ſo long vpon it, till they haue falne, and many by daungerous familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue been deceiued. Rather let them flie carefully the aſpect and haunt of thoſe, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies may endanger them, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Counſel of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in it; <hi>If thy hand or feet ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize the, cut them off,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or if thine eye, pluck it out:</hi> which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſome Saints haue followed ſo neer, as S. Bridget in particular, not only auoided in her ſelf al oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſinning in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but to auoid it alſo in others,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95:81"/>she prayed to Alm. God, he would conuert al the vertue she had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deformity: Others there haue been, that haue disflgured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues rather then to giue cauſe to any temptation; and others ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſuffer the effect of it, haue willingly departed with their proper liues. Which I will confirme by an example taken out of the ſecond part off the FF. Minors Chronicle.</p>
            <p>A Burgundian Gentelman had a daughter ſo affected to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Mother of God, that ſecretly from her tender yeares she vowed her virginity to her. This virgin had a corporal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auty, ioyned to the beauty of her ſoule, ſo taking, as it attracted to her the harts of al. Among the reſt, a ſeruant of her fathers was
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95:81"/>one, who omitted no arts not induſtries to oblige her to a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal affectiou to him; But this not taking, his loue grew deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, and at length engaged him in as deſperat a courſe; For his Lord and al his ſeruants being gon a hunting, he ſecretly, returned home, when his daughter was either not accompanied at al, or els ſlenderly only by her maydes; and taking that opportunity to execut his wickdnes, went and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d her out, where in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel she was proſtrat at her deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before a picture of the Queene of heauen: into which he entred audaciouſly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reuerence to the place, or reſpect to the perſon, tould the reaſon of his réturne, and how deſperatly he was in loue with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95:82"/>her, coniuring her by al the force of a wicked eloquence to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his deſires. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat the Virgin was ſo ſtruck at the firſt, what with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence of the fellow, what with the horror and vnexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his demand as she remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a while deuoyd of ſpeech and ſenſe, til at laſt rowſing her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits vp, with a iuſt diſdaine and bashful anger, ſhe anſwered him; Gett hence thou impudent vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, and ſeek out ſome others more fitt to heare and grant thy ſuite then I: and whence is this inſolence in thee? haue you euer ſeen any thing in me, that should thus embolden it? but ceaſe your boldnes and your inſolence, or I know the way to bring you to deare repentance of it the fellow
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95:82"/>at this, growne wholly deſperat; and rageing no leſſe for anger then for loue, drew out his ſword, &amp; fixing the point againſt her throte, told her there was but one way with her, eyther to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to dy, or to ſatisfy his deſire; thy deſire (ſayd she?) rather then by me ſuch a wicked deſire shalbe euer ſatisfied, had I a thouſand liues I would willingly looſe them al; but you conſider better (ſaid he) for aſſure your ſelf I am not in ieſt; Bee in what mind thou wilt, replyed she, doe thy worſt, and when thou haſt done, goe vaunt to ſuch as thou art, how thou haſt traiterouſly murthered thy Lords daughter in his owne houſe in defence of her Chaſtity. This put him wholly into the hands of furye and deſperation,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95:83"/>and made him at one blow cutt off her head. When flying inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Vicar of the place who was his Vncle, he made him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with what he had done; Who being much troubled at it, adviſed him to lye concealed in a ſecret place which he shewed him, til he had don Maſſe and had further aduiſed what courſe to take with him. Meane while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a ſtupendious miracle. An Angel ſent from heauen preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnited the trunke of our be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Virgin ſoe properly to the head againe, as there only remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a red ſtreake about the neck in memory that it was once cutt of when she reſtored to life againe, had preſently recourſe to Church to heare Maſſe, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thankes to Alm: God for that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95:83"/>miraculous fauour; Being there, it happened the Curat at the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertory deſcending from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, with much aſtonishment eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied her, and beleeving it rather ſome phantaſme come to fright him, then her returning to life againe, ſuſpended his aſtonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and his feares, til after Maſſe, when he repaired vnto her more fully to informe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of what she was; Then she reconted from point to point, al that had hapned to her, greeuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a complayning of his Nephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes barbarouſnes, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of his irreuerence towards God and his B. Mother: The good man loſt in admiration of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, as ſoone as he had found himſelf, was al in teares, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching her to keepe ſecret this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95:84"/>haynous offence of his Nephew, and pardon it. For my particular, ſaid ſhe, I doe from my hart; but how Heauen wil pardon him; I know not; For that, ſaid the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, I truſt in the infinite mercy of Alm. God, only yours was al my feare, and there vpon he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his Nephew, who on his knees shedding aboundant teares beſought her of pardon; when she rayſed him vpp, and as if she had forgotten how much he had offended her, in this mild manner ſpake vnto him: My freind, ſaid she, I haue already paſt my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to your vncle that I wil for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue you; only procure by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to purchaſe the forgiuenes of Alm. God, and his B. Mother, or I aſſure you, a more rigorous puniſhment then this world has
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95:84"/>any, is in ſtore for you: Sweet Miſtres, ſaid he, (making profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reuerence vnto her, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by his ſighes; and teares a more profound greefe &amp; ſorrow) how good and gratious you are, not only to preſerue my tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life, (which if you pleaſed to take it; were forfaited vnto you) but to take ſuch care of my eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal on; yet beſides this fauour I muſt needs begg another, which is, that from that mouth, which for ſo greeuous a treſpaſſe has pronounc't my pardon, I may heare what penance I shal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme for it Since you wil (ſaid she) you shal; only take it by way of councel not of command, and it is this, That you become a Friar Minor, and before you are ſo, Confeſſe your ſelfe wholy and

And by this we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue; how ſuccourable the B. Virgin is, to thoſe who for the Imitation of her, preſerue this virginity ſo carefully, as rather to depart with it, they choſe to depart this life.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95:86"/>of theſe three excellent vertues in her, may excite vs to an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionat deſire of them, eſpecially that of purity of mind, it being the moſt exquiſit beauty of the ſoule, and an ornament which moſt of al illuſtrats it. Now this purity of mind is nothing els (according to Albert the great, as he alleaged by S. Antonine) but a receſſion from al impurity, which is ſinne, and an acceſſion to God the ſoueraigne purity &amp; in this conſiſts the true ſanctity of the ſoule, for the more we weed it of imperfections, the more place is left for perfections to ſpring vp in it; and ſo S.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95:86"/>conclude, that purity is no other thing, then an exemption from al imperfection.</p>
            <p>Let the pious Reader then ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the purity of the B. Virgins mind, who of al the Children of Adam was not only exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted from al actual ſinne, but alſo from ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; and that becauſe of the conueniency (as S. Anſelme would haue it) that she who was the Mother of God should next to him haue al imaginable purity; which could not be, if she had not been preſerued from original ſinne. Beſides, God hauing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated her to a degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the higheſt that any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could be capable of, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed conſequently he should endow her with a purity aboue al other creatures, and ſo al the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95:87"/> of his power wiſdome and goodnes, (we may imagine) were at once imploied in enrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching her with ſuch guifts and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural preparations, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her of al creatures the moſt eminent; in ſuch manner as thoſe who had but the eies of ſpirit open to penetrat into the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and perfection of her glorious ſoule would infallibly more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire Gods workmanshipp, and ſee more admirable effects of it in her; then in the fabrick and creation of the Vniuerſal. Neuer any thing came immediatly out of the hand of God, but it was pure, perfect and compleat; he created the Angels from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Heauens perfect and pure, he created man likewiſe ſoe, of the moſt pure-parts of the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95:87"/>Earth, and Eue from the pureſt fleſh and bone of Adam, whilſt he was yet in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency was created pure; and the reaſon is, becauſe the nigher to the principal of puritie a thing is, euer the more pure it is. This being ſo, what can be more reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plendent (ſaies S. Ambroſe) then she in whom purity it ſelfe cloſe to abide? what finally more vnblemisht, then she whom the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God choſe to inueſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe withal? And if God hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured other creatures with that highe prerogatiue to be borne in grace and exempt from ſinne, who can doubt but she in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner was borne ſo, and exempted aboue the reſt? For what incongruency els were it to haue the mother inferior to her
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95:88"/>Children the Queene to her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and. Seing then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and both Adam and Eue more created in grace and in the ſtate of innocency, why should we deny the Queene of Angels, and the repairer of Adam and Eues offences, the life preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue? Yet let vs paſſe farther, and affirme the B. Virgin excelling in purity by infinit degrees not only al men and women in the world, but alſo al Angels, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changels, and the higheſt Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins in heauen. For this, S.

            </p>
            <p>Her ſanctity then being ſo great, we may wel conclude of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95:88"/>her, that there was neuer in her any blemish of ſinne, nor the leaſt shadow of imperfection. Let vs conſider her then, being ſo imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate as she was, as an Idea fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by God, of al Chaſtity, as a liuely paterne of perfection in women, model of ſupreme purity and finally ſchoole of al Vertues, Virgin both in mind and body, humble of heart, graue in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, prudent in action, neuer ſtirring abrode til inuited by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſober and mortified, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alwayes in her Contenance a holy bashfullnes, her gate wel ordered and compoſed, ſimple in Clothing, moderat in her voice, neuer laughing but weeping of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſparing of ſpeech, alwayes wel imployed, hauing ſtil in hand ſome profitable booke, aſſiduous

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95:89"/>thuſian) we may imagine theſe beames proceeded, which shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from her countenance ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her ſo reſplendent and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable to al that regarded her; al which were nothing yet in compare with the inward rayes that illuſtrated her mind, which gaue light vnto the Angels of light themſelues; her regard was ſuch according to S. Ambroſe &amp; S. Bonauenture) as her bare ſight was ſufficient to reclaime euen thoſe that were furtheſt gon in ſinne; but that which was moſt, admirable in her, and which moſt rauishes in aſtonishment both men and Angels, was her being at once both Mother &amp; Virgin, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in purity, &amp; Mother in fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; A prodigie of al others the moſt ſtupendious, and a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95:90"/>only appropriat to this rare Phenix of perfection; for to whom els were attributed euer theſe ſupreme titles of honour, Virgin before child-birth, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in child-birth, and Virgin after it? Yet? tis an Article of ſaith, and al doubt thereof inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the holy Church; for the Conſummation of which, we wil here relate a Miracle happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to B. Giles one of the firſt Companions of S. Francis, and it was this.</p>
            <p>A Religious Diuine of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of S. Dominick, being once vehemently tempted by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel ſworne Enemy to the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) to cal in doubt her vndubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Virginity, and not ſufficing by his owne forces to shake it off, was reſolu'd to vſe the helpe of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95:90"/>ſome other, and hearing the fame of B. Giles for ſanctity, reſolu'd it should be he. Being on his way towards the Conuent where the holy man reſided, who by diuine reuelation vnderſtood the cauſe of his iourney, behold he was ready to meete him, and embrace him with al the freindly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a Religious charity; and e're euer the other opened his mouth to communicat with him of his temptation, he ſayd vnto him; Brother and freind, aſſure your ſelfe, shee was a virgin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore child-birth; when raking the ground with a litle wane he had, one Lilly preſently ſprung vp, then conuerting himſelfe to him againe; ſo aſſure your ſelf, ſaid he. ſhe was a virgin in child-birth, &amp; a ſecond Lilly ſprung vp in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95:91"/>therof; finally, the third time addreſſing himſelfe to him he ſaid, aſſure your ſelfe laſtly (ſaid he) that ſhe was a virgin after child-birth too; and this by the ſpringing vp of a third Lilly, being confirmed alſo, the Diuine remained deliuered from his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and rendred infinit thanks to Alm. God, for his ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deliuery.</p>
            <p>Let this ſuffice for a more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple confirmation of the ſoueraine Puritie of the Queene of heauen. Let thoſe then who deſire with a due purity of hart to ſerue this glorious Virgin, endeauour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al their forces to imitat her, in her admirable purity and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of life, that is, to haue a hart vntainted, and free from al contagion of ſinne, eſpecially
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95:91"/>ſuch as are mortal, ſince, as the Angelical Doctour teaches vs; The farther that purity is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from ſinne, the purer ſtil it growes; ſo ſhal wee haue part in the benediction: <hi>Bleſſed are the pure of hart, for they shal ſee God.</hi> And to come yet neerer to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, thoſe are pure of hart, whoſe conſciences are free from mortal ſinne; thoſe more pure, are likewiſe free from venial; but thoſe moſt of al, who accompany this freedome from ſinne, with the aſſidual practiſe of vertue, and this according to S. Chriſtſoſtom, is to be pure of hart. S. Hierome defines it, to haue a conſcience that can accuſe vs of no ſinne, at al, ſuch an one as that of our B. Ladyes was, who according to S. Bonauenture, was ſo pure from
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95:92"/>ſinne, as it was reueal'd to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſon, as her conſcience vnderſtood not what it meant. O happy and a thouſand times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are ſuch as thoſe, whoſe breaſt being pure, &amp; inueſted with theſe white robes of purity, do ſerue in that liuery the ſoueraigne Queene of heauen; for theſe are truly her ſeruants, theſe truly her fauorits, and ſuch as in the next life ſhe peculiary honours and aduances aboue the reſt.</p>
            <p>We reade of S. Lewis Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Tholouſe, who iſſue from the Royal bloud of France, and was once a Frier-Minor; how he in his life neuer committed mortal ſinne; this holy Saint dying at the age of 80 yeares, a certaine Frier-Minor farr from the place of his death, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95:92"/>of his infirmity, had a viſion iuſt at the inſtant of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of innumerable Angels bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſoule to heauen, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing melodiouſly on the way; <hi>So are they rewarded who ſerue God in purity and chaſtity of hart;</hi> and for his chaſtity and purity we haue the atteſtation of al that conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him, that al his actions and wordes ſauoured of nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>And as vehemently is the B. Virgin diſpleaſed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vice, as with this vertue she is pleaſ'd; as witneſſeth this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſtorie recounted by the learned Pelbart; A yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a debaushed life, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome deuotions in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the B. Virgin, she one day whilſt he inuoked her aide
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95:93"/>(being ſtraied in a wildernes &amp; almoſt famished) appeared vnto him accompanied with a glorious train of Virgins, bearing in their hands al ſorts of delicat meates, but ſerued in ſo foule and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome dishes, as although his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was moſt vrgent, yet for very loathing he would not eate a bitt; which the B. Virgin perceiuing, aptly took occaſion to reprehend him ſaying; euen ſuch are your deuotions you offer vp to me; Good in themſelues, but coming from one ſo foule with ſinne, my heart ſerues me not to accept of them; ſo ſhe vanished, and left him ſo ſtrucken with this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion by the bitter ſlaine of his former life, as for the time to come he wholy amended it.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe then, who haue the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95:93"/>honour to be ſtiled the ſeruants of the B. Virgin, that their ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be the more acceptable to her, endeauour to keepe vp, to the higheſt point of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of purity of hart, that is, to be ſo farr from the conſcience of any mortal ſinne, as euen to decline venial as farr as it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; from the which the farther they are, the nigher they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vnto perfection, and the more they increaſe in grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of life. Happy is that ſoule then, which growing dayly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter in this purity of hart, shal finde a ready way to euery grace and perfection it shalbe deſirous to obtaine, &amp; merit to haue Alm. God amply communicat them vnto vs, whoſe property it is to be moſt bountious of his fauour
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95:94"/>to the pure, to impart himſelfe vnto them in a particular manner, and enrich them with his diuine Conſolations. And this Hart of ours being a thing of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, each leaſt defect in it, appeares to be deformity, it being (as Bro. Giles was vſed to ſaye) like a bright mirrour which the leaſt breath would ſett a blemish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For which reaſon the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo earneſtly recomends vnto vs the Cuſtody of it. <hi>Looke Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to thy hart,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>for thy life depends on it.</hi> And ſo we ſee, how litle a thing diminishes of its merit and purity; an idle or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous word a litle leuity in our actions, a friuolous Curioſity, a leſſe modeſt regard, immoderate laughter, or ſuch like, which we account of as things light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95:94"/>Now the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this purity of hart, we muſt be moſt careful of our Exteriour ſenſes, our eyes, eares, ſmell, touching, taſting, &amp;c. leaſt the Enemy preuaile himſelf by them againſt our ſelues.</p>
            <p>To expreſſe the danger of which F. Iacopen of the holy Order of B. Francis, hath an apt ſimilitude; There was (ſayes this holy man) a Virgin of excellent beauty, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for her dower a Iewel of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable price, who had fiue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers al poore and neceſſitous; the one a Muſician, the other a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the third a Perfumer, the fourth a Cooke, and the fifth a ſetter of others chaſtityes to ſake One day the Muſician addreſt himſelf, vnto her, and with an accent, as charming, as it was pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95:95"/>deſired her of pitty in his extreme neceſſity, if euer Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſayd he, were deare vnto you, or if euer you knew what pitty meant, declare it now in your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting me; giue me your Iewel to redeeme me from my wants; it is a bould requeſt I grant, both in regard of the greatnes of its value, and the ſmalnes of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruings, but the greater honour wilbe yours, with ſoe vn-intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Charity, to aſſiſt a brother in his neceſſity, and the greater wilbe my obligation; and heer ſo pauſ'd a while, as if his greefe had ſtopt the paſſage of his ſpeech; But she remaining Inexorable to his prayers, anſwered him thus: My deare brother, I would do much for you, but ſatisfie your demand I cannot; for the ſame
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95:95"/>Charity which obliges me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit others, firſt of al obliges me to benefit my ſelfe; what a folly were it in me then, by my enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching others, to make my ſelf for euer poore, you know I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but it to maintaine my life, and to depart with it were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my life te extreme neceſſity; Wel (anſwered the Muſician) then, ſince you wil not giue it me, at leaſt ſel it me: and what wil you giue me for it? I wil take my Lute, ſayd he, and ſing you two of the neweſt Ayres at Court at this ſhe laughing, ask't him, when they were done, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines for her to liue vpon? no, no, ſayd she, brother you shal pardon me, I wil not ſell ſoe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious a Iewel for ſo ſlight a thing. After him the Painter came vnto
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95:96"/>her with the ſame requeſt, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one of his beſt peeces, in exchange, but she refuſed him as she had don the former. Then the Cooke, &amp; the Perfumer came next, this profering for it, one of the delicateſt perfums he had, the other the moſt ſauory dishe he could inuent; but they as the former fayling of their pretenſes; the fift lewd Companion, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe vnto her, who knew wel the arts of perſwaſion, and how to inſtil his words into the mind, offred her for it, after a world of ſmooth and ſoothing word, her choice of a hundred Paramours; But being as the reſt reiected, it hapned not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that a mighty King moued by the fame of this riche Iewel, came to demand it of her, off ring
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95:96"/>to marry her on the condition that he might haue it, &amp; giue her for dowry his Immortal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; when she ouercome by the greatnes of his offers, but much more by the goodnes of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, thus anſwered him; My Lord, it were Impudence in me to refuſe you, wherefore behold I freely giue it you, without any reſerue at al, and deſire no other recompenſe for it, but that you would vouchſafe to accept it; and excuſe the ſmalnes of her merit that giues it you. This ſimilitud the holy man would explicat in this manner; The Virgin is the ſoule, the Iewel, the Free wil she hath; her fiue brothers, her fiue Corporal ſenſes; the King, Alm. God; as for the reſt, is obuious enough.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:95:97"/>
And heere I could take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to inveigh againſt thoſe, who would beheld deuout (forſooth) to the B. Virgin, and haue no Care the while of bridling their ſenſes, but let them run on to al licentiouſnes; nay, which is worſe they continue ſo, til the end of their liues, without any remorſe, out of a vaine preſumption they ſhalbe ſaued becauſe of ſome odd deuotions they exerciſe, then which what greater folly can there be, what greater blindnes? not to ſee how the diuel drawes them as it were bound hand and foote to hel. For example, you shal ſee many, (I ſpeake it with greefe and shame enough) ſo addicted to the devotion of the Annunciat, as they would not omitt it for a world, (and 'tis
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95:97"/>commendable in them) but marke how they abuſe it; the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous effects which they ſo ſpread of it, makes them preſume the like; for what wil they ſay: neuer tel me of Hel nor of the paines thereof, though I ſinne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much, I ſerue a Miſtres who hath both wil and ability to helpe me out of it, and let me but Confeſſe my ſinnes at the houre of my death, and I am ſure of heauen; ſee how theſe miſerable wretches talke; drawing a wrong conſequeuce from an Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent moſt true, that the B. Virgin both can and wil ſuccour her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: but they muſt be ſuch as make due vſe of her fauours, and employ the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in working their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: ſuch indeed shee ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times helpes ſo efficaciouſly, as in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95:98"/>shipwrack she keepes then from perishing in the ſea, and frees them from al dangers on land of enimyes, theeues, and Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and al this to bring them to amendment of their liues: But thoſe who rather grow worſe by it, or out of preſumption of it ſeeke not to amend at al, for my part I hold their ſafeties deſperat. Then there is a difference of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for ſome ſinne of deliberat wil, and make not due vſe of their deuotion to the B. Virgin, nay, as I haue ſayd before, euen abuſe it to greater licentiouſnes of life, and ſuch are in a moſt dangerous eſtate. Others only ſinne, out of humane frailty, and by giuing too much liberty to their ſenſes, doing it with a remorſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and greeuous deſire to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95:98"/>amend their faults, though they be neigligent to put their good deſires in excution: and for ſuch, it is eaſier for them to diſpoſe them ſelues for grace, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle themſelues of thoſe Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations the B. Virgin procures them for the amendment of their liues, themſelues, both the one and the other are to honour the B. Virgin, and reuerence her with al becoming reuerence, that she may obtayne for them of her B. ſonne condigne penance for their ſinns, &amp; amendment of their life. Let them like wiſe endeauour to make themſelues partakers of that laudable deuotion of the Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat, ſince thoſe who haue been of it, haue been in fine recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for it, and I exhort as wel the Iuſt and thoſe of better life to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95:99"/>this, as alſo ſinners and euil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers; ſithence if theſe find ſuch benefit of it, how much more muſt they, who are intimate freinds as it were to God and his B.

The Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues although adorn'd with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt ſanctity, were not exempted from it, only the B.

            <p>Al the Sacraments of the Church, according as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Trent defines, were inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Sauiour Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and had their firſt origin from his ſacred ſide, at what time both blood &amp; water came iſſuing forth, and are ſo many rindets as it were, by which his aboundant grace is deriued vnto vs. Let them
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95:102"/>therefore who frequent them, make account (eſpecially this of Confeſſion) that they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by it, to the ouer: flowing fountaine of our Sauiours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious bloud, by vertue of which their ſoules are wash't and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the foulnes of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: which the Apoſtle S.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95:102"/>of grace, from vice to vertue, from eternal paine vnto eternal bliſſe.</p>
            <p>Of al deformities, mortal ſinne is that, which renders a ſoule moſt deformed, in ſo much as could we but ſee à ſoule in ſtate therof, we should euen die for horrour, it would be a ſight ſo feareful and hideous: whereas no ſooner it hath been cleanſed by the ſacrament of Penance, but it produces againe a new beauty &amp; for moſity. So S. Gregory the great ſayes: Could we but ſee a ſoule made to the reſemblance of God, euen in <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> we ſhould admire it to adoration, &amp; beleeue the Creatours beauty himſelfe hardly ſuperiour to it. For which reaſon (ſayes the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Tilleman) God hath incloſed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95:103"/>it in this corps of clay, leaſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding it-ſelf, ſhould be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of that Luciferian pride, which was ſo many Angels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And for this cauſe thoſe ancient Fathers of the Aegyptian deſerts in eleuating their mindes to their ſoules high <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and taking the true altitude of their creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, were as it were alienated from themſelues; In ſo much (as we reade of S. Antony) as often as he was called on to pay the debt of nature either in food or ſleep, or any ſuch corporal neceſſity, he euen bluſh't for ſhame, that ſo noble a ſubſtance as the ſoule, should be intereſſed in ſuch baſe reckonings. Now if a reaſonable ſoule be of it-ſelfe ſo beautiful, what great addition muſt it needs receiue from the Sacrament of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95:103"/>Penance, which reſtoring it to its natiue luſter, add to it beſides, that of God Almighties ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural grace? Certainly there is no eloquence in the world can ſpeak it ſufficiently, no liuing imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can conceiue the hundreth part of its excellence. The Sunne (ſayes S. Chriſoſtome) with his cleare rayes doth not ſo illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat the world as the Grace of Alm. God can do a ſoule. Which that of S. Catharine of Sienna wel declares; who hearing a Preacher once diſcourſing of the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy thereof, and how exceedingly it beautifyed a ſoule, conceiued an ardent deſire to behold a ſoule in Grace, and aduantaged with al the beauties thereof; Ful of this deſire, she was no ſooner depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the ſermon, but she hard
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95:104"/>a voice from heauen ſaying vnto her: <hi>Catherine, preſently thou shalt ſee the fruite of thy deſire;</hi> and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her into her Oratory, she there beſought God for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his promiſe, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly beheld a perſon of incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Maieſty al Circled about with light and shining with clear ſplendours; at the ſight of which, she was ſo rapt in admiration and reuerence, as she preſently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated her ſelfe before its feete with intention to adore it, had it not with theſe words prohibited her: <hi>Catherine for beare for I am</hi> not God, as thou imagineſt? and who then? anſwered the Saint; I am, ſayd it, the ſoule of a certaine Murtherer you prayed for not long ſince in ſeeng me ledd to execution who being new clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95:104"/>in the fire of Purgatory, and going al purified to heauen, after I shal haue left you ſatisfied of your deſire by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Alm. God. And after this time, the holy Saint had a particular in fight by Alm. God beſtowed vpon her, of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of each ſoule, and she was wont to affirme vnto her Gloſtly, Father, that if he ſawe but the beauty of a ſoule, she was aſſured, he would: ſpend 1000. &amp; 1000. liues for the ſauing of one.</p>
            <p>The grace of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance hath a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous vertue, not only to purifie the ſoule confeſſant from the ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of finne, but alſo to beautify it with good inclinations, and from a ſlaue of ſinne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt for good, to render it free &amp;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95:105"/>expedite; which we wil declare by an example out of Caeſarius. There was a learned Diuine (ſay's he) exemplar in al vertue called Thomas, who approching to his end, ſaw in a corner of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the diuel appearing in a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful shape; to whom he with an vndanted couragc thus ſpake; What art thou there cruel beaſt, ſayd he? tel me, I coniure the, what amongſt Chriſtians is the thing which afflicts the moſt? but he forbearing to anſwer him, the holy man iterating his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the name of God charged him to ſpeake: when at laſt the diuel thus anſwered him; Know (ſayd he) there is nothing in the Church of God afflicts vs more then the frequenting the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Confeſſion, ſeeing when
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95:105"/>a man is in mortal ſinne, he is as it were bound hand and foote, wholy diſabled from doing any good, and when he repayres to Confeſſion thoſe bonds are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and he is reſtored to liberty againe; and ſo certainly ſinnes are nothing elſe but ſo many chaines which tye vs as it were vnto the gates of hel, and ſo the Prieſt in the act of Abſolution ſayes: <hi>I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue thee from thy ſinnes;</hi> and a mighty power the Confeſſours hath, or rather a mighty loue our Sauiour hath of vs to inſtruct &amp; furnish them with ſo great a power as they haue. We ſee, ſay the holy Fathers, when a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal confeſſed his ſinnes vnto an' earthly Iudge, he is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for it, but the contrary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens at the Tribunal of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95:106"/>Church, where the Prieſt preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and repreſents the perſon of our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe: For thoſe who confeſſe, goe away wholy acquited and abſolued.</p>
            <p>Al good Chriſtians then, as ſoone as they are falne into mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſinne, are preſently to procure to purge themſelues of the foule ſtaine of it at the fountaine of Confeſſion; and if we be ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reful when the leaſt ſpott appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res vpon our garments, to washe it out; how much more careful ought we to be to washe out the blemishes of our ſoule? for the which, although Contrition may ſuffice accompanied with a firme purpoſe of Confeſſion, not with ſtanding who can ſecure his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience whether he hath had true Contrition or no, or that rather
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95:106"/>it hath not been a greefe leſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for his ſinnes proceeeding rather from the feare of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then a true loue of God Almighty, as it ought to do; ſuch as the Diuines cal <hi>Attrition,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſufficient of it ſelfe to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from our ſins, nor conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute vs in the ſtate of Grace, nor conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to free vs from dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation should we dye in that ſtate of minde; whereas but ioyne it with Confeſſion, and it is aboundantly ſufficient, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſupplying al that was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it of true Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trition.

The purity of hart then being a thing of ſo ſingular recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Queene of heauen, let al who profeſſe themſelues her ſeruants ſeeke to purchaſe it, and purchaſing it once embrace it with al their might; to which end lett them know, that according to the opinion of al, there is no more efficacious way to do it, then that of the Sacrament of

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95:112"/>welcomed them with ſuch ſignes of affection, as for his owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could not haue expreſſed more, this moued the wonder of al that were preſent there, but much more that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; when he ſeeing their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hang al frozen ſtiffe about them, and their feete and leggs chapt through the extremity of cold, was ſo moued thereat, as he preſently ſeating them by the fire cauſed a bath of hott water to be brought, and he himſelfe washed their feete: then after he had a while refreshed them there, he comanded a chamber next his owne to be prepared for them; whither hauing conducted them he addreſsing himſelfe vnto the father ſayd; My good father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue me I beſeech you in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy;

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95:114"/>accuſers departed fruſtrat of their intents. Heer the viſion vaniſhed, and the Religious man ſtarting out of his ſleepe, called to his Companion ſaying: My brother, my brother, the Gentleman of this houſe is dead, and which is more, is ſaued; and heere he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him the whole progreſſe of his viſion. Hereupon they both roſe and calling to them of the houſe, aduertiſed them of what had happened, telling them for certaine that the Maiſter of the place was dead: at this, al were wonderfully amazed, and his wife the moſt afflicted woman in the world, not ſo much for his temporal death, as his eternal, which withgood cauſe she feared, til the Religious aſſured her that he was ſaued, and that by the ſame
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95:115"/>meanes he came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his death, by the ſame he vnderſtood of his eternal life; So a great part of her ſorrow being taken away, the reſt ſhe beſtowed vpon his Obſequies, al that either knew his life or death, admiring in it the wonderful mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oies of Alm.

            <p>From this Example let ſinners take Inſtruction, to be alwayes charitable to the poore; &amp; though their ſinnes be neuer ſo many, yet neuer to deſpaire of the ſweet goodnes of Alm.

            <p>And S.

But what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that men goe to it with ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſubmiſſion and reuerence, when euen the Angels &amp; diuels adore and reuerence it.</p>
            <p>The B. Brother Stephen (as it is recorded in the Chronicles of our Order, celebrating Maſſe one day with great guift and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, the Acolothite who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him falling a ſleep, hauing been ouer-watched the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; Two deuout women being

            <p>But what wonder if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels honour and reuerence their eternal King, when euen the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels themſelues euen do it, as is manifeſt in they ſtorye follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: In Germany there was a certaine Virgin poſſeſſed by the Diuel, who before this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accident, was of rare vertue and ſingular piety; It happened once as she was iſſuing forth of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95:120"/>the Church with diuers others, a Preiſt paſſed by, bearing the B.

            <p>The B. Virgin not only adored this B. Sacrament, on earth, but now in heauen actually Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues her Adoration; which we may confirme by a ſtorye taken out of Vincentius his Mirrour
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95:121"/>Hiſtorial the. 17. booke, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by diuers other Authors of worthy credit: There was, ſayes he, a Curat of euil life, addicted to his pleaſures, and one who ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died more to flay and kil his flock, then to feed them; It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in his parish at the ſame tyme there-fel ſicke a riche Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leman of prime quality, and a poore widow of a vertuous life; the Vicar chooſing rather to viſit the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman (as one from whom there was ſome what to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for) left the widow without help abandoned: and after he had diſpatch't with him, ſlightly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Confeſſion and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the other Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, yet he remained lingering there ſo long impertie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntly flattering the Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leman with hope of life, though
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95:121"/>he euen ſaw death in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, (only in hope of ſome temporal benefitt) vntil the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow mindful of her eternal good; ſent for him being almoſt in her laſt Agonie: but he ſticking faſt there, in hope of gaine, could not be drawne from thence: which his Vicar perceiuing, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with compaſſion; alaſſe Sir, ſayd he, ſuffer not this poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to dye thus deſtitute of help, but at leaſt ſend me thither: if you wil not goe your ſelfe: Goe, if you wil, ſayd he, for my part I wil not leaue this Gentleman where there is hope of ſome what to be gott, to viſit a begger where there is nothing but miſery: he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon the Vicar went with the B. Sacrament for her Viaticum, to viſit this infirme creature, poor
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95:122"/>indeed of worldly riches, but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in heauenly, without which al is pouerty: and he was no ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner arriued at the doore, where the poore ſoule lay only vpon a litle ſtraw, but he beheld the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Queene of heauen, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with innumerable troopes of Angels and Virgins, aſſiſted at her happy departure, at the ſight of which the Vicar ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in his thoughts a while, whether he should enter or no, at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting from his owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines on the dignity of him who was in the Sacrament which he brought with him, he confidently entred in, when the B. Virgin and al her Glorious trayne with humble reuerence adored it, and preſently vanished away. When the good Vicar in extreme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95:122"/>approched to the Couch where the poore widow lay, and hauing heard her Confeſsion and communicated her, the happy ſoule preſently looſened from its mortal bones, tooke flight immediatly to heauen.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, things ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary at the riche mans houſe; whither the Vicar was no ſooner returned, but he beheld the Gentlemans bed, al incircled in with ougly black ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, with horrible noyſe, skree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and roarings affrighting of his ſoule, whileſt he cried out in horrible diſmay: helpe, helpe, my freinds, theſe wicked ſpirits are haling me, and with their gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes they euen preſſe me to the hart: alaſſe! I am a loſt and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man: and at laſt, whilſt the

            <p>Imagine but what impreſſions the whileſt the concurrancy of theſe two Viſions made in the heart of the good Vicar, and how deuoutly afterwards he reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the B.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95:125"/>of his Maieſty: holdes the firſt ranke and place. This adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to S. Iohn Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene, conſiſts in an interiour Act by which the Creature teſtifies his ſubmiſſion vnto his Creatour, by ſome exteriour ſigne either of vncouering the head, bowing the knee, inclining the body, or the like. With this ſupreme ſort of Adoration the three Kings ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Infant Ieſus in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers armes; <hi>And entring the houſe</hi> (ſayes S. Mathew) <hi>they found the Infant with Mary his mother, &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the ground, they adored him</hi> words which excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly wel decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the greatnes of this adoration; by which the Kings and Monarks of the earth humbly bow the head and knee vnto the King and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narke of the heauens.</p>

                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:95:126"/>
Now to ſpeake of the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proper to the B. Virgin, the next degree to that of God, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the Diuines diſtinguish it by the name of <hi>Hyperdulia</hi> from the reſt by which al creatures both in heauen and earth count it as honour to adore the ſacred Queene of heauen.</p>
               <p>According to the opinion of ſome Diuines, God had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner created the Angels, but he let them vnderſtand, how his B. Sonne was one day to become man, and this man ſhould be their God.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the B. Spirits with regard vnto the time, honoured him as ſuch, and conſequently (as Suares ſayes in following Saint Thomas his opinion) they odored his Mother as her who
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95:126"/>was to inueſt him in mortal flesh.</p>
               <p>And 'tis an approued veritie of al the Doctours and the cheife of them al S. Paul; that the Sonne of God being come into the world, al the Angels came to adore him. So (ſayes he) <hi>when he ſent his firſt borne ſonne into the world, he ſayd; Let al the Angels of God adore him:</hi> And S. Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and other deuout writers ſaye, that when the Infant Ieſus was borne in the Stable, al the Angels in their ſeueral Quiers came to adore him, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps viſibly in humane shapes, the more to honour his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; After which they did their ſeueral reuerences to his B. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one and the other ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diuine and melodious Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of prayſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:95:127"/>
Now if the B. Spirits with ſuch profound reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce adored the B. Virgin while she was yet reſident in the world, what exceſſiue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours may we imagine do they render her now in heauen, where next to God she holds the ſecond place? inveſted with incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble glorie at the right hand of her B. Sonne? For my part I am of opinion, that their moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary exerciſe is to honour the Sonne &amp; Mother with inceſſant adoration; and ſo we read how S. Iohn rauished in extaſye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Angels incircling the Throne of God, and falling on their faces before it adoring the B. Trinity, and the ſacred Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, daughter of the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother of the Sonne, and ſpouſe of the holie Ghoſt: by
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95:127"/>which doth clearly appeare the excellency of this adoration, both <hi>Latria, and Hyperdulia,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by al the Court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto their King and Queen.</p>
               <p>If then theſe glorious ſpirits honour with ſo ſoueraigne and magnificent a kind of Adoration the Mother of Alm. God, with greater reaſon ought we to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her, by how much greater her fauours and graces haue been to vs, then to them. Let vs then honour her with al poſſible reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to shew our ſelues grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vnto her for her benefits: Of which we reade a rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Example in <hi>Scala caeli;</hi> and it is this.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:95:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>when the B. Virgin, after she had moſt ſweetly comforted him (as a pledge of her deare acceptance of his deuotion) added vnto his terme of life twenty yeares, and reſtored him to his perfect health againe. A ſtrange fauour, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferr'd not ſo much vnto the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral vigour of the man, as it did to his ſpiritual in deuoutly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her.</p>
               <p>But in the laudable exerciſe hereof, we are not ſo much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the otward comportment of the body, as the inward diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind in framing a deuout conceipt of the B. Virgin, imagining her preſent as often as we exhibit to her any corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reuerence, and beholding vs the while with a deare regard, whereby this one deuotion will
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95:129"/>become more familiar to vs, and our remembrance of her more deare and cordial, ſo as we ſhal take pleaſure to ſpeake with her and of her, on al occaſions, and more confidently preferr our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to her in our neceſſities; And this affection whoſoeuer shal conceiue of her in his mind, is in a moſt happy eſtate &amp; may wel preſume of his ſaluation, and to be one of the number of the elect; whence he cannot but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience an incredible ioy of minde, ſince (according to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine graue Authour:) <hi>If thou feele in thy hart</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>a ſingular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and deuotion to the glorious Virgin, it is a ſigne of thy Praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to eternal life, and thou mayſt wel be glad and reioyce at it.</hi>

               <p>Theſe holie motions and pious
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95:129"/>affects of loue &amp; reuerence were found in that deuout woman, of whom it is recorded in <hi>Scala celi;</hi> That being of noble birth, though fortune were wanting to her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and hauing two daughters, whom ſhee carefully had educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in deuotion to the B.

               <p>Knowing then for certaine, that in honouring the B.

This how grateful it is vnto her, she her ſelf declared to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Capuchine of our order, one moſt deuout vnto her.

               <p>And let none imagine this a deuotion only for women or the ſimpler and vulgar ſort, for al are equally obliged to honour her, of what ſexe, eſtate, or condition ſoeuer they be; the Patriarkes &amp; Prophets (as the Diuines affirme) acknowledged her worth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:95:136"/>her for it thouſands and thouſands of yeares, before she was borne into the world: But what do I talke of Patriarkes and Prophets, when the Angels them ſelues at the firſt inſtant of their creation, beholding her in the Eternal Word, humbly reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and adored her, as one that should one day be their Queene in heauen, and be the mother of their King on earth.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95:140"/>to God can be ſaid or imagined.</hi> From hence the holy Fathers inferr, that the title of being Mother of God, is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine from whence do flow al her other graces and prerogatiues; for ſo, ſay they, whence was it, that from al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity she was in a particular ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner predeſtinat; becauſe ſhe was to be the Mother of God. Why was ſhe ſanctified by the holy Ghoſt in her Mothers wombe? to be the more worthy receptacle of the Sonne of God. Why in her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was ſhe exempted from original ſinne? that the eternal Word might from her body take immaculat fleſh. Why was ſhe exalted aboue al the Thrones &amp; celeſtial Hierarchies? but becauſe ſhe was the Mother of God, who is the ſoueraine King of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:95:140"/>earth. Whence in fine, is it, that the Princes of heauen and earth, nay, euen of Hel it ſelfe, bow downe and do reuerence at men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her name, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe she is Mother to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord of al, to whom al do homage, and in whoſe preſence al the great ones that are, ſhrinke vp to nothing, and not appeare at al. O wonderful greatnes of this highe and excellent dignity beſtowed vpon a ſimple Virgin! Who is not aſtoniſhed, who is not alienated from his ſenſes with admiration? to be at once a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a Virgin! to containe in the narrow incloſure of her wombe, him whom the heauens with al their height &amp; latitud can not containe! to be Mother of the moſt deare delights of the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:95:141"/>Eternal Father, and the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious obiects of Angels, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally (which is the moſt prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of al) to haue produced her Creatour, and brought her Father forth. Theſe are things aboue al capacity, rauiſhing nature with aſtoniſhment and wonder, ſo as with good reaſon the holy Church ſayes of her: <hi>Nature admired, when you brought forth that holy one, who brought forth you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The B. Virgin then merits in being Mother of God, al imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable honour from one creature to another, and in particular that which the Diuines intitle <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulia,</hi> which alſo admits of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiſion, according to Suarez, into ſuperiour &amp; inferiour; with the Inferiour thoſe are honored, who haue ſome particular excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

               <p>And in regard of this high and moſt eminent dignity of hers, al Creatures in heauen and earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence her, and acknowledge her for their ſoueraigne Lady and Queene, and at her name the greateſt Potentats on earth bow downe their knees, and do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reuerence; ſo al generations of the world praiſe and honour her, as ſhe in her Canticle diuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:95:142"/>preſaged: <hi>Behold from henceforth al generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s shal cal me bleſſed;</hi> &amp; <hi>de facto,</hi> what people, what nation is there on the earth, ſo irreligious and barbarous, who haue her not in honour and reuerence?

               <p>As witneſſeth this maruay lous ſtory recorded by the learned Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert in his Stellary of the B.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95:143"/>gates which finding shut, he was forced to take ſanctuary in a litle Chappel of the B. Virgins then open by chance, where hauing leiſure to looke about him, he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed an Image of our B. Lady in Relieue, ouer the highe Altar, at ſight of which he was ſo ſtrucken with shame and repentance, as caſting him on his knees with a dolorous accent; <hi>Too great</hi> (ſayd he) <hi>too great, O ſacred Virgin, is your beingnity to me, who haue ſo greeuouſly offended you, to Protect and conceale me in this my flight; but I ſee it is true what I haue often hard, that your Clemency is the greateſt maruayle in the world, and that but regard it, &amp; it is vnmeaſurable euery way: I implore then that ſweet cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of yours no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſaue my life, for the horriblnes of my Crime, hath

               </p>
               <p>He had proſecuted his ſpeech, but the Officers entring the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, interrupted him, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, interrupted him, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on him, they carried him priſoner to the Prouoſt of the place; where he was no ſooner come, but falling on his knees before him, he ſayd vnto him with a reſolut countenance; I do not this to moue you to Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my crime, and ſaue my life, but only to begg this fauour of you, that I may haue the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines to be baptized before I dye.</p>

                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:95:144"/>
The Prouoſt no leſſe reioycing then wondring at his demand, gladly granted him his requeſt, and hauing receiued him from the Font himſelfe, that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, being ouer, he proceeding to the examination of his fact, not letting the pleaſure of the one, hinder the diſpleaſure of the other. But behold, while this was in agitation, the mother powring forth her affection in laments ouer the murthered carcaſſe of her Child, by degrees perceiued it ſtirr, and fixe its eyes vpon her with a gratious ſmile, and being in a tranſport of ioy and admiration therof, at the ſame inſtant was brought her the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of her husbands Conuerſion; whereupon she inſtantly tooke her child, and preſented it aliue
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95:145"/>before the Prouoſt, no marke nor ſigne remayning that euer it had been dead, but only a litle ſtarr where he had giuen the wound. The Prouoſt beholding this ſupendious miracle, abſolued the Criminal as one who already was abſolued from heauen; who being a learned man and a great Rabby in the Iewish law, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wars wholy conuerted his tongue and penne to the ſetting forth the prayſes of the B.

               <p>Nay, euen the Turkes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and impious Moores con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr in honouring the ſacred Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; and reuerencing her as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, as appeares by the greeuous penaltyes impoſed by
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95:145"/>their Alcoran, on any whoſoeuer shal blaſpheme her name. But what should we ſay of the honour exhibited to her amongſt the Chriſtians, when ſcarcely is any ſo poore a village or hamlett, where she is not honoured; by ſome place of deuotion dedicated vnto her? and her Images and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures are in ſuch veneration, as who hath not part in the worship of them?</p>
               <p>A yong Scholler (as Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius in his hiſtorial Mirrors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth it) being ſo deuoted to her, as he vſed on his knees, as often as any Image of hers occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd, to ſalute her in this deuout manner. <hi>Haile Mary</hi> &amp;c. or this: <hi>Bleſſed is the ſacred Virgin; wombe that bore the Eternal fathers ſonne, and bleſſed the breaſts that gaue him

Sonne, ſo neere and deare vnto him as she is, and whom the reſt of Saints, only a farr off reuerence and admire? And if it be true, that each ones glory beares a proportion with the grace they haue, &amp; the more their grace on earth the more their glory in heauen; how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in glory muſt she bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue them al, who was ſo farr ſuperiour to them in grace? for who knowes not, how from the very inſtant of her Conception,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95:148"/>when she was ſanctified in her Mothers wombe, God went hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping more and more graces vpon her ſtil, vntil her death when the accumulation was Complete, and how in al tymes she cooperated with him in al her actions, in al occure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, ſtil meditating how to add vnto it, accompanying al her exteriour workes with the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour intention of the minde; Which Albert the great exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifies very wel in that treatiſe of his, <hi>de beata Virgine;</hi> and S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard more particularly where he ſayes. This Virgin and mother of the higheſt, not only waking but euen ſleeping had the fruition of heauenly things in Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no earthtlye affaire being ſo forcible, as to interrupt her Commerce of thought with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95:148"/>in ſo much as euen in her ſleepe she was buſyed more in Contemplation then the reſt of the Saints when they were moſt perfectly awake. Who then, of what intelligent a ſpirit ſoeuer they bee, can comprehend the immenſity of the grace and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the glorious Virgin, &amp; conſequently the infinit glorie she had in recompence, ſeeing as the ſame Doctours affirmes; <hi>The more she excelled others in grace on earth, the more glory she obtained in heauen.</hi> Let vs conclude then, that her glory there, is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, and ſurpaſſes by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite degrees that of al the Saints &amp; Angels; Conformable to that ſaing of S.

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95:149"/>Apoſtles, Martyrs, Patriarcks Angels, Trones, Dominations, Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, nor Churubins; in fine, there is no viſible nor Created thing more great or more excellent then she.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And S. Anſelme; <hi>Ineffable</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and euer-more admirable is the grace and greatnes of this Virgin:</hi> And in proſecuting his diſcourſe: <hi>And what, O B.

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:95:149"/>for it in heauen; as is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by verity it ſelf: <hi>Vvho humble themſelues, shalbe exalted,</hi> &amp;c. And that great light of the Church S. Ambroſe ſayes: <hi>The more abiect we are on earth, the more we shalbe exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it in heauen:</hi> And he adds; <hi>That by ſo many degrees of humility we deſcend on earth, by ſo many of glory we shal aſcend in heauen.</hi> Since no creature euer thought ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and abiectly of her ſelfe as this B. Virgin did, we may wel imagine, that by this pretious vertue she ſo wonn the hart of God, and gott ſuch hold of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that ſhe euen obliged him by it to deſcend from heauen to earth into her wombe, and chooſe her for his ſpouſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which ſhe in that Canticle of hers Confeſſes of her ſelfe:
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95:150"/>
                  <hi>Becauſe he hath regarded the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his hand-maid,</hi> &amp;c. Which ſhewes the excellency of her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. And S. Bernard ſayes of it, that when the Angel ſaluted her, her anſwering him in that manner ſo humble, and reſigning her ſelfe entirely vnto the Wil of God: <hi>Behold the hand-maid of our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Was more grateful vnto God, and meritorious for her, then al the actions of men and Angels put together, and that by it alone, ſhe merited, the being Mother of our Sauiour Chriſt: <hi>Neuer</hi> (ſayes S. Bernard) <hi>had she been exalted aboue the Angels, if she had not humbled her ſelfe before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if ſome Saints, as namely S. Francis, haue merited by their humility, to be ranged amongſt the Seraphins the cheifeſt Order
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:95:150"/>of Angels and next to the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; to what immenſitie of glory are we to imagine the B.

In conſideration of which, we may wel imagine, that her glorie and felicity as farr ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that of al other Saints, as the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do a litle point, the cleare light of the Sunne a candle the Ocean a ſmale drop of water, or al the earth the leaſt graine of ſand.</p>
               <p>With good reaſon then, ſince she is exalted to ſuch a height of dignitie, we are to honour her, as the ſoueraine Queene and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe of men and Angels; and as eminent as she is in dignity ſo is she in beautye and amability, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obſcure with the brightnes
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:95:151"/>of its ſplendour, not-only al hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane eyes, but euen thoſe of the Angels themſelues, as appeares by this ſtory recorded by Herod Religious of the Order of S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick.</p>
               <p>There was a yong ſcribe (ſayes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he) much deuoted to the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, who being ſome-what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in the holy Scriptures where her excellent beauty is commended with ſuch Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums, he at laſt grew paſſionatly deſirous to ſee her in that beauty she appeared with in heauen, &amp; praying for the accomplishment of his deſires, he heard a voyce reprehending him for it, in that he ask't a thing aboue his capacity &amp; which his eyes were too weake to behold, nor could it coſt him leſſe then his ſight the beholding
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:95:151"/>it; but he willing to put it to the venture, perſiſted ſtil in his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet at laſt vpon more mature reflexion, he reſolu'd, if the fauour were granted him, to reſerue on eye at leaſt whileſt only with the other he regarded it; And ſo it happened that she appearing vnto him in a moſt glorious and reſplendent manner, that one eye with which he regarded her, being ouercome with the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the obiect, became who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blind; but ſo farr was he from euer repenting it, as with itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted petition he be ſought her, to appeare but vnto him in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry once agayne, and he would be alſo willing to forgoe the other eye; the B.

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:95:152"/>that penalty vpon him which he did expect, as she reſtored him his other eye againe, wher with we may imagine how contented a man he was.</p>
               <p>Neither doth she exceed al the Angels and Saints in beauty and ſplendour only, but alſo in ioy and felicity, which with out doubt she hath in as ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree aboue the reſt, as her glory aboue the reſt is more high and eminent; And for that there are diuers Doctours who affirme, that she alone hath more glory then al the Saints together; this being ſo, imagine of what ioy &amp; felicity she is poſſeſt the while, the quality of which is ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly rauishing, that S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine doubts not to affirme of it, that one dropp of heauenly feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:95:152"/>but falling into hel, would ſweetenal its torments. O ſtrange expreſſion of the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drous ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and deliciouſnes thereof: if one dropp of it could worke ſuch effects in hel, what muſt whole torrents of it worke in the harts of thoſe who are poſſeſt of it? The Apoſtles vpon an arid and barren mountains topp, ſawe but only a litle glimpſe of the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in our Sauiours Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and taſted by it but a litle ſuperficial ioy, and yet you ſee they could haue been content to haue remained there al their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. But that example which I shal now declare, deſerues yet greater admiration.</p>
               <p>A certaine Religious Monke of holy life, exerciſed long in the contemplation of the Ioyes of Heauen, conceiued at laſt ſuch
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:95:153"/>a feruent deſire of it, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly beſought Alm.

               <p>One of the ancient Prophets in conſideration of the greatnes of this glorious Pallace of Alm. God exclaime: <hi>O Iſrael, how great is the houſe of God, how mighty great is the place of his poſſeſsion? he is great and hath no limits, he his high

Now the B.

It is impoſſible to imagine the number that waytes vpon her there; which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet endeauouring to ſpeake of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:95:159"/>ſayes. <hi>Ten thouſand ſerue thee, and a hundred times ten thouſand aſsist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee:</hi> ſetting downe a finit number for an infinit. And S. <hi>Denys</hi> ſayes, that the number of Angels by many parts exceeds the number of al Corporal and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things. And for thoſe, we know, how the ſublunary bodies yeild in greatnes to the celeſtial bodyes, and they vnto the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the more high they are; in ſo much as not a ſtarr of the leaſt magnitud, but is farr greater then al the globe of inferior things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. We know beſides, that euery man from Adam to the Conſummation of the world hath had and shal haue an Angel Guardian to attend vpon them, be they good or bad, al equally par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating of this benefit; whence
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:95:160"/>it followes, (as we haue ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that the number of Inferiour Angels deputed to that charge, exceedeth the number of al men that euer were, are, and shal bee; which being ſo, how innumerous muſt the ſuperiour bee, ſince (as we haue formerly deduced) they increaſe in proportion the more ſuperior they are. Certainly, more eaſy it were, to number al the ſtarrs in heauen, the drops of the Sea, the leaues of trees, the plants of the earth, and the Atomes of the Sun, then the multitud of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels knowne only to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Let vs add moreouer, the better to ſett of the glory of our ſouerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne Queene, a ſecond wonder in traine of this; to wit; That al the Angels, as infinit as they are,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:95:160"/>haue each one yet a diuerſity among themſelues; and if it be ſuch a delightful ſight, to ſee a Garden al planted with variety of flowers, how much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful muſt it bee, to ſee theſe Angelical flowers adorning the heauenly Garden with each one their ſeueral ſpecies according to their ſeueral dignity and merits? And heere our Imagination hath a ſpatious feild, to exerciſe it ſelfe in deuout conceipts of the B. Virgins perfections and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; for if the Courtiers ſtriue with ſo much ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dor, how much more ſplendid muſt needes that Maieſtie bee, on whom they al attend.</p>
               <p>For ſo theſe B. Spirits are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually attending before her Throne adoring her, and ready at
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:95:161"/>the leaſt twinkling of her eye, to execut her commands, which are commonly for the good and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of man. This is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of S. Auguſtine where he ſayes: <hi>S. Michael and al the other Angels haue an eye in heauen vnto the B. Virgin, to ſee where shee would Command them any things for the good of ſoules on earth.</hi> Let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then; that her Greatneſſe are vnſpeakeable and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible not only by men but euen by the Angels themſelues, and that next to God she hath the moſt ſoueraigne command in heauen, as being Queene of al the celeſtial Hierarchies there, and Mother of the ſupreme Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narck and Creator of euery thing.</p>
               <p>Neither-doth her dominion terminate or end heere, but as
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:95:161"/>she is Queene of Angels, and of Heauen, ſo alſo is ſhe of Earth &amp; the Inhabitants thereof; and for this reaſon the Diuines cal her fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Regina mundi,</hi> the Queen of earth. S. Gregory often intit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les her to the name of <hi>Lady of al Chriſtians;</hi> &amp; ſo with good reaſon may ſhe bee, who was ſo great a part of our redemption, for God had neuer been made man but for her, and conſequently had neuer ſuffered for vs, nor gone through with the worke of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which ought to be a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Motiue to induce vs to honour and reuerence her.</p>
               <p>Nay, euen the very diuels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues do dread her power at the ſole inuocation of whoſe name they al are put to flight; <hi>When I pronounce but Aue Maria</hi> (ſayes the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:95:162"/>deuout S. Bernard) <hi>the Heauens do ſmile, the Angels reioyce, the world exults, hel trembles, and the diuels are in diſmay.</hi> S. Bridgitt in the firſt booke of her Reuelations ſayes, that the B. Virgins rankes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity in heauen is ſo ſupreme, as the diuels are conſtrained to honour it; and ſhe addes: That as often as any shalbe moleſted by their temptations, let them but inuocat her ſacred name, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they al ſhal vaniſh and be put to flight, of whoſe ſole Command they more ſtand in awe, then of al their torments; ſo as whenſoeuer ſhe vndertakes the cauſe of any ſoule, they dare not withſtand her in it; as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth this ſtory regiſtred in the <hi>Promptuary</hi> of her Miracles, and taken out from thence by <hi>Pelbert</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There was a man (ſayes he) of a nature ſo euil inclined and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, as he neuer was exerciſed in any good, but only in ſome few reuerences and praiers which he daily offered vp to the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. This man, though often inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired to leaue his wicked life, was yet ſo farr from it, as he perſiſted more obſtinat in it euery day, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at laſt in drawing his lateſt breath, he imagined himſelf hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by a crew of diuels, with horrible noyſe and howlings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the tribunal of the Iudge; where they demaunding iuſtice, and the Iudge putting them to declaration of the cauſe, they clearly proued him a moſt wicked man, and as ſuch deſired ſentence ſhould be giuen on him; When
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:95:163"/>the B. Virgin ſtanding vp in his defence, declared whatſoeuer good ſhe had knowne by him, like a moſt faithful Aduocate; but ſcarce had ſhe finiſhed her ſpeech, when in an inſolent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the diuels argued againſt her thus; is this al you are able to ſay for him? vnleſſe you defend his cauſe better then ſo and bring more proofes of goodnes in him, what, for his bad, wil become of him may be eaſily ſeen; &amp; heere he began to add vnto the liſt of his offences thouſands and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more, when the B. Virgin ſeeing their number ſo great, as by the way of Iuſtice there was no hope for him, shee ſtrait ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt her ſelfe by that of mercy, and proſtrating her ſelfe before the Iudges feete, no ſooner he had
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:95:163"/>raiſed her vp, but ſhe began: if theſe pretenders to Iuſtice (ſayd ſhee) were intereſſed in the cauſe more then out of malice, they ſhould carry it and I would not ſo much as diſpute it with them, but to what end al this long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation of crimes what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes it them whether your inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations were obeyed or no? or ſince when haue they been ſoe iealous of your honour, that they ſhould care ſo much where you were diſhonored? certainly, if there be any fault, it is cheifly theirs, and if there be any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence it is only yours; it is you only whom he hath offended, and to you alone he is ready to make ſatisfaction, not with any boaſt of merit, or that he ſtands on iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his cauſe, but with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:95:164"/>in his heart, teares in his eyes, &amp; ſighs in his mouth, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of your mercy, what of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice he cannot hope for. I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe the quantity &amp; quality of his cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are ſo enormious great, that they deſerue nothing but death &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation; but if my prayers were euer powerful with you now hear my prayers for him, and by theſe breaſts which had the honour once to giue you ſucke, I coniure you; for ſo many drops of milke you haue receiued from them, to beſtow one drop of bloud of the aboundance you haue ſhed for ſinners, to waſhe this man from his ſinnes; for his life hereafter I wil vndertake, ſo as you wil pardon what is paſt; for I ſee al ſignes of a repentant ſinner in his heart, his eyes, and al; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding heere with a profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:95:164"/>the Iudge remained a while with his eyes fixt vpon the ground in great ſuſpence, now weighing the mightines of his crimes, now of her power that interceded for him, whilſt either part was wauering betwixt hope and feare; at laſt lifting vp his eyes, &amp; caſting them on her with a gracious regard: Though it be exceeding much you aſke, ſaid he, yet were it much more I could not deny it ſuch an interceſſion; for your ſake then I pardon him this once, but neuer let him hope for pardon againe, if he abuſe it now; hauing ſayd this, the diuels confounded departed with horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cryes ſaying; We knew wel enough what would be the end of it, ſhee euer hath the better of vs, and 'tis our folly to contend
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:95:165"/>with her, she is too powerful an Aduocate, and too gracious with the Iudge: ſo they vanished away, and the poore man returning to himſelf againe, recounted to al this horrible viſion, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Phiſicians for his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral health, and the diuels for his ſpiritual, he recouered both, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of either ſuch vſe for the time to come, that he entred into Religion, and there to his dying day ledd a moſt holy life.</p>

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:95:168"/>been confounded; who euer implored your aide, and been abandoned?</hi> And to this purpoſe is that ſaying of Origen: <hi>I hould for certainly true, that the B. Virgin being inſtantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched for any thing, is neuer wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the necesſities of him who beſeeches her, for that she is al mercy, and ſo ful of grace, and therefore she cannot chooſe but haue Compaſsion of thoſe who craue her helpe.</hi> Excellent words, and able to animat the moſt deſperat to a hope of his ſaluation, and allay the moſt ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tragious affliction which was euer in any breaſt. Being our Mother then, she cherished vs with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal loue, and hath more care of vs then euer any Mother had of her only child, neuer fayling vs with ſuccour in our neceſſities, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in our dangers, comfort

So is she our aduocate in heauen with Alm.

Bernard encourages man to preſent himſelfe without feare before Alm. God: <hi>Go, Go, with Confidence,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>before the throne of his diuine Maieſtie where the ſonne beholds the Mother; and the father the ſonne; the ſonne shews his father his

               </p>
               <p>But yet this is not al, nor doth this careful Lady and Mother of ours only procure vs fauours, but she aſſures them vs by appeaſing her Sonne when we haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and reconciling his loue vnto vs againe; but for her, how often had the world been thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by that iuſt Iudge aboue? how often had the ſoules therein, for their offences, been precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and caſt downe head long into Eternal hel? Of which a more cleare example cannot bee, then that memorable viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:95:171"/>behold heere ready two ſeruants of yours (pointing out to S. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis and S. Dominick) apt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to employ therein, and to exhort them vnto penance, after which if they perſiſt in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, do your iuſtice what it wil with them, I haue done with them. Hereupon his diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie let his thunder fal out of his hands, his boyling anger coole, and at his Mothers prayers was for that once content to pardon man.</p>
               <p>Hauing then a Mother in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo powerful as she, let vs haue recourſe to her, and put vs in shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnder her, as children do vnder their Mothers when they fly their Fathers wrath; and that eſpecially when wee finde our ſelues moſt preſt with ill fortune or calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:95:171"/>and ſay vnto her: <hi>Sub tuum praeſidium,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O mother of God and of vs, wee put our ſelues vnder your paotection, refuſe vs not in our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, nor abandon vs vnto the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that threaten vs;</hi> and haue a firme confidence that she wil ſuccour you, and haue pitty of your miſerable eſtate, who neuer refuſes thoſe who haue recourſe to her. In ſo much as a holy Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour ſayes; If ſo great be the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our crimes as we feare to appeare with them before Alm. God, our beſt courſe were to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe our ſelues to her, and she infallibly wil ſuccour vs. And S. Chryſoſtom in one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſayes vnto her; You haue been choſen from eternity (ſayes he) Mother of God, to the end that thoſe whom God in iuſtice
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:95:172"/>cannot ſaue, should arriue by your pittiful interceſſion vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And with this accords wel that Viſion which B. Leo had, one of holy S. Francis companions, in which he had a repreſentation of the finall Iudgement day, where he ſawe two ladders reared vpp, the one a read one reaching from earth to heauen, where our B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour al in terror ſate; the other of white, iuſt of the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion extended to the B.

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:95:172"/>them to clime by that white one, and he would aſſure them of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeed; and he ſawe that thoſe who followed his counſel were gratiouſly receiued by our Lady &amp; introduced into heauen. From which viſion, and we haue before deduced, reſults an euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t proofe of her motherly Care of vs, and how she loues vs euer to paſſion procuring with extraordinary ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitud al wee ſtand in need of both in heauen and earth. With good reaſon then ought we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence her, and haue her in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and veneration; with good reaſon are we to ſerue her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately, and conſecrat vnto her the beſt deſires of our hart; and this al lawes both diuine and humane exact of vs, to witt, that if she be our mother, we should
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:95:173"/>loue and honour her; and if a loue and honour be due from vs to our parents who engender vs into this world, with how much more reaſon is it due to her, who ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refully procures our regeneration to a better life?</p>
               <p>Let vs not ceaſe then to loue &amp; reuerence this ſoueraigne Lady both of heauen and earth ſince God himſelfe doth it as wel as we, and (according to <hi>Methodius</hi>) hath a kind of obligation alſo to doe it, she being his Mother, and conſequently the precept of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring our parents hauing alſo reference vnto him, yea and it ſeemes in more particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner vnto him then vs, ſince she was more particularly his parent then any can be ours, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had no other on earth
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:95:173"/>but her, as alſo becauſe she could haue no other ſonne. You haue good reaſon to reioice (ſayes the ſayd <hi>Methodius</hi>) ſince you haue him in a manner on the ſcore with you, to whom al mortals are indebted elſe. And ſo he went ſtill honouring her heer on earth, as his deare Mother, and as ſuch was obedient to her; <hi>et erat ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus illis,</hi> as the holy Scripture ſayes; neither doth he leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her now in heauen, but (as ſome deuout Doctors ſayd) after his glorious reſurrection firſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting her with a <hi>Salue ſansta Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens;</hi> he iterated it at her Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption into heauen, and there ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her at his owne right hand, al the Court of heauen doing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to her the while, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted her in abſolut power and

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the precedent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters we haue ſeen of what excellency and valour is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Reuerences to the B. Virgin, and how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto her it is, we haue moreouer ſufficiently informed our ſelues of the reaſons which should moue vs vnto her reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as that she is the mother of the king of heauen, her ſurpaſſing glory there, and that she is of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:95:175"/>higher dignity then al the quiers of heauen, that she hath al power heer on death, and finally that she is our Mother and ſoueraigne Lady alſo. And yet much more could alleage I alleage to moue vs to deuotion, did not the feare deterr me of ingulfing my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo wide and profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d an Ocean. Wherfore now it remaines that I treat of the Method we are to vſe, to put in practiſe this ſo laudable deuotion.</p>
               <p>Firſt then I ſay, we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour by often genuflexions and inclinations of the body to honour her; in which the better to actuat our ſelues we are to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish from vs al tepidity and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zynes; and make choice of time and place moſt conuenient for it: and firſt, touching the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:95:175"/>of place, priuary is the chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thing we are to regard; of time, the night ſeemes fitteſt as that, which is freeſt from diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; beſt compoſeth the mind.</p>
               <p>We reade in <hi>Surius,</hi> how S. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth daughter of the King of Hungary exerciſed herſelfe with ſuch affections in this ſo laudable deuotion, as ſhe appointed one of her women euery night to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake her at a certaine houre by ſome ſecret way ſhe had, when ſhe would riſe vnknowne to the Prince her husband, and ſpend moſt part of the inſuing night in theſe adorations which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Breuiary makes mention of; <hi>Shee riſing in the nights</hi> (ſays it) <hi>from her husband, and the time in prayer and genuflections.</hi> At which time, no doubt, but the Angels
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:95:176"/>reioyced to ſee her vertuouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, being riche and noble by birth, but far more by vertue and her true deuotion, and finally her performing that on earth, which the Angels account themſelues happy to do in heauen.</p>
               <p>Now for the number of them, I wil preſcribe none, but leaue it to the deuotions of thoſe who are deſirous to exerciſe themſelues therin, nor the manner how it is to be done, either of bowing one knee to the ground, or both, of lifting vp their hands or croſſing them before their breaſts, but let them chooſe that poſture which likes them beſt, and which makes moſt for their deuotion.</p>
               <p>Only I wil ſpeake a word or two in the commendations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in general, as firſt, of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:95:176"/>wherewith it is don, there being none ſo much employed or infirme, who cannot with eaſe do ſomewhat in this kind, either in bending the knee, or bowing the head, actions which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with al, in what eſtate or imployment ſoe'r they be. Then it is a king of deuotion (this of adoration) of al others the moſt noble and acceptable to the Queene of Heauen, the office of Angels, and who then would not be ambitious of it? to doe the ſame on earth, which al the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Courtiers do in heauen? and I beſeech deuout perſons, that they would but conſider, how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and with what care your earthly Princes are ſerued and honoured by their followers and Courtyers; which whoſoeuer shal,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:95:177"/>but obſerue, muſt needs blush for ſhame, if they be not as careful and aſſiduous in ſeruing their Queene of Heauen.</p>
               <p>And to incite our deuotions thereunto, it would do wel to read of the diligence of Saints in this particular; as namely in Surius of <hi>S. Albert,</hi> how he bowed his knees a hundred times a day, and fifty times proſtrated himſelf on the ground, ſaying each time an <hi>Aue Maria</hi> in honour of the Queene of Heauen; And of S. <hi>Catherine</hi> of Sucina daughter of S. Brigit, how (according to the ſame Authour) she was from her tender infancy ſo exerciſed in prayer, as beſides our Ladye Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which she recited euery day, with the Penitential Pſalmes &amp; other ſuch deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, she imploy'd
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:95:177"/>her ſelfe fower houres euery day continually in this exerciſe of genuflexions vnto the B. Virgins honour, accompanying it with many teares. As for that which S. Iohn Damaſcen hath left writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of <hi>Simon Stilites,</hi> it doth more cauſe our wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der then imitation; his ſtanding on a pillar, expoſed vnto the rigors of winters and ſcorching of so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers heate; thirty fixe cubits highe, ſituated on an eminent Mountaines topp; and this continued for more then thirty yeares, making a thouſand and a thouſand genuflexions and inclinations euery day; and one of the ſeruants of B. Theodoret Bishopp of Cyrene obſeruing him one day, counted aboue a thouſand two hundred and forty inclinations of his, and that of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:95:178"/>thoſe more painful ones, he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it were) euen round in performing them.</p>
               <p>So of the glorious Apoſtle S. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew we reade; that, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times a day and as many by night, he vſed to bend his knees, which was more in one who was ſo perpetually and aſſidually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in preaching and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the world, then a hundred times ſo much were in another man. Wel did he vnderſtand of how highe price and value with the B. Virgin theſe Reuerences and adorations were,) vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding things in ſuch an illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue manner as he did) or els he had neuer been ſo careful &amp; pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in performing them.</p>
               <p>But no wonder that the holy Saints and freinds of Alm. God
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:95:178"/>haue produced ſuch ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge effects as theſe, &amp; left to vs ſo litle hope of imitating them, ſince the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine grace that ſuperabounded in them, the ardent fire of the holy Ghoſt that inceſſantly inflamed their harts, and that height of perfection they had attained vnto al concurred vnto the rendring them actiue vigours and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in this holie exerciſe. But as for vs weaklings as we are, deſtitut of thoſe ſpiritual forces which they had, and that mind to apply thoſe forces to the beſt; if we cannot imitat them ſo nearly, yet at leaſt a farr off we may do ſomewhat in their imitation; and bitter is it ſo to do, &amp; do it deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then weary our ſelues by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing too much, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wholy dulled and diſ-ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:95:179"/>and rather looſe ſpirit then gayne by the exceſſe.</p>
               <p>There is an Example concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this, taken out of the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of examples which is this. A certaine Religious woman had a daily deuotion to ſay an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty <hi>Aue Maries,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying each one with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reuerence; but ſhe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold in the performance of them, by reaſon the number ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med exceſſiue great, was diuinely admonished in viſion to diminish them to a third part, vnder the condition that she should ſay thoſe with greater feruour &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion. And S. <hi>Hierome</hi> to this purpoſe ſayes, it is farr better to ſay one Pſalme deuoutly and with alacrity of ſpirit, then the whole Pſalter with negligence and tepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:95:179"/>Notwithſtandiug, ſuppoſing al be equal, certainly much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is, to do more then leſſe, in theſe or any other exerciſes of piety, ſince good workes ar the more meritorious ſtil with the more difficulty, they ar perform'd and the more grateful is the doing of it, to thoſe vnto whoſe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencs it is exhibited.</p>

               <p>S.

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:95:182"/>I neuer did any good in al my life, but only in honour of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin faſting Saturdayes, for which reaſon when my ſoule was iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing forth of my body, as it was ſeperated from my head, and the diuels ready to intercept it, were al aſſembled, behold the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin hindred them, nor would she ſuffer it to iſſue forth of my body, vntil by Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion it were expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of its crimes; and therupon hauing confeſt himſelfe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring al the aſſiſtants to pray for him, he exchanged this life for a happier on.</p>
               <p>This day then being particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly conſecrated to the honour of the B. Virgin we should do wel; to add vnto our faſts this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of lowly inclining and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerencing her; It being of ſuch
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:95:183"/>excellency as we haue declared before, of which each one may offer vp as many as his deuotion shal ſuggeſt, and time and place permit. How euer for the more certainty, might I preſcribe them a taxed number, it should be the number of the Beads, to wit ſixty three, in honour of thoſe yeares, which (according to ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours) the B. Virgin liued vpon earth, and ſo it were beſt to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them vpon their Beads, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them the while with that attention, as if the B. Virgin were really preſent there; and while they do it, they may at earth one pronounce thoſe firſt words of the Angelical ſalutation <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> which ſome are of opinion the Angel pronounc't in actually bowing his knee and lowly reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:95:183"/>her, with bowing downe his head; But of this we ſhal ſpeak more amply in the 11. chapter of this booke, where we ſhal teache an apt Method of putting in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe this exerciſe; and what I ſay of the Saturday, may be obſerued when any of her leſſer feaſts oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr.</p>
               <p>As for the Greater feaſts, the greater the ſolemnity is, with the greater deuotion we are to ſolemnize it; wherfore it were wel if on ſuch dayes as thoſe, we encreaſed to a hundred the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe reuerences, it being a number much celebrated in the holy Scripture for perfect and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious; but I would not wiſhe you to performe them al at once, for feare of taediouſnes, but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide them ſo, as both morning,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:95:184"/>noone, afternoone, euening, and night, may haue its parting, which in the former number of ſixty three I would likewiſe haue obſerued, that we may come to it with fresh deuotion, and renue the memory of our B. Lady more affectionatly and often; And if the feaſt be celebrated with an Octaue, we may celebrat each day of the Octaue with this deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when if we begin the vigil with a hundred and ten, and ſo continue the Octaue out, we shal make compleatly vp, the number of a thouſand, a number perfect, ſacred, and myſterious.</p>
               <p>This excellent deuotion was moſt frequent with S. Margaret daughter of the king of Hungary Religious of the Order of Saint Dominick, who (as Doctor Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:95:184"/>of the ſame Order recounteth in her life, was ſo affectionatly deuoted to the Queene of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as she no ſooner ſawe her I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in any place, but she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently kneeled downe before it, reciting in her honor the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical ſalutation, and on the Eues of her moſt ſolemne feaſts she alwayes faſted with bread and water; from which day til the concluſion of the Octaue she ſayd a thouſand <hi>Aue Marias;</hi> at each one of which she humbly proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her ſelfe on the ground, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it her greateſt delight next to honouring Alm. God, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his B. Mother.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>PON occaſion of treating of the feaſts of our B. Lady, I am put in minde to ſpeake a word of the feaſts of our B. Sauiour which we are to honour aboue al the reſt; and with good reaſon, for if the feaſts of creatures (as we haue ſayd) may be celebrated in their honour, how much is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour on his feaſt to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Al thoſe deuotions we may exerciſe on his feaſt, which we
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:95:185"/>haue taught to be exerciſed on the feaſts of our B. Lady: alwayes prouided that we reuerence him in a higher ſtraine of <hi>Latria,</hi> only proper to God himſelf: <hi>Thou sbalt honour &amp; ſerue the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c</p>
               <p>The principal feaſts of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt which are celebrated with their Octaues are fiue; the Natiuity; the three Kings adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Reſurrection; the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion; &amp; that of <hi>Corpus Chriſti.</hi> or the bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt; amongſt which I place in the higheſt ranke that of the Natiuity, becauſe on that, al the Quires in heauen deſcended vnto the earth, to adore their King then an infant lying in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or in his mothers lap. And ſo the deuout ſoule that exerciſeth theis deuotions on that day, is to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:95:186"/>frame a liuely imagination of the place imagining themſelues in Bethleem, and adoring amongſt the reſt him, whom al both in heauen and earth adore.</p>
               <p>The feaſt of the three <hi>Kings</hi> puts vs in minde of nothing but adorations, ſince on that day they al adored our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in his Mothers lapp, and in them al the nations of the world; and with how much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion it was accompained may be gathered from this patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal expreſſion of it by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt Saint Mathew: <hi>And entring into the houſe</hi> (ſayd he) <hi>they found the infant with Mary his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and falling on the ground adored him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The glorious <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> to the dignity of which, al other
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:95:186"/>feaſts giue a kinde of pre-hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, deſerueth Adoration like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; becauſe on it our Sauiour roſe againe al victorious and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, charged with the ſpoyles of hel, while the Angels adored him reioycing at his triumph, and ſinging in his prayſes their ſongs of ioy.</p>
               <p>And what should I ſay of his moſt glorious <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> on which our Lord and Sauiour after his victories, made his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent entrance into Heauen, and there being ſeated at the right hand of his Eternal Father, to whom he was euery way equal in power &amp; vertue, al the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Hoſts the while humbly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before his Throne, did him moſt proſound honour and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:95:187"/>
Now let vs come to the feaſt of <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> or the B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which al the others are compriſed, and conſequently more then al the others we are to reuerence it. And is not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually celebrated each day, and in each place (almoſt) through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world? do we not behold a world of Maſſes ſayd, and people dayly communicating through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al Chriſtendome? do we not ſee in euery kingdome &amp; almoſt euery litle village the B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment kept, and adored with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable reuerence, where our Sauiour Chriſt is as really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as he is in heauen, where An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints are inceſſantly adoring him. Wherefore we are neuer to enter into any Church, or paſſe by any Altar where the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:95:187"/>B. Sacrament is kept, but we are humbly on our knees to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence it. And happy are thoſe, who performe this deuotion not perfunctoriouſly, or for cuſtome, as many do; but with guſt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and from their harts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the ſweetnes of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe they do; perhaps they may deliuer ſome ſoule out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory by it; (with ſuch deuotion it may be done): which arriuing vnto heauen, wil there become perpetual interceſſors for them to Alm. God; than which a greater benefitt cannot be imagined.</p>
               <p>But alas, (I cannot ſpeake it without teares) we ſee Chriſtians the while ſcarce vouchſafe to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their heade or bend a knee before this B. Sacrament, ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerent and weak they are in
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:95:188"/>their faith of it; Impudent and irreligious as they are, not to know how this myſtery ſurpaſſes al diſcourſe and al humane capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and that faith heer is al the light we haue. <hi>Let faith Commend to vs what we can neither ſee nor comprehend,</hi> ſayes the holy Church in one of its Hymnes, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place: <hi>Ad firmandum Cor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerum, ſola fides ſufficit: For to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme a hart ſincere; only faith ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient were.</hi> And yet how many cleare teſtimonies haue we had of the verity of this by euident miracle: ſometimes it hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the forme of a litle child in the Preiſts hands at the Eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſome times the very beaſts themſelues (leſſe beaſts then ſome men therein) haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged their Lord and Creatour
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:95:188"/>in it: as witneſſe thoſe Miracles which I shal here recount.</p>
               <p>Al Paris in the yeare. 1258. a certaine Preiſt ſaying Maſſe in a Chappel adioyning to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, as he eleuated the ſacred Hoſt, a litle child of incredible beauty appeared in the place of it; Which Miracle being repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to S. Lewis King of France; and ſome ſoliciting him to goe and ſee it amongſt the reſt, he made anſwer worthy of ſo pious a Prince; Let thoſe goe who doubt of the reality of his being there (ſays it); for my part I behold him daily with the eyes of faith.</p>
               <p>The other Miracle happened at Tholouſe in Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, recorded in the Chronicles of the Minims, as alſo by Surius and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:95:189"/>and it is this: S. Anthony of Padua being there, had a fearce diſpute one day with an obſtinat heretike, denying the reality of our Sauiours body in the B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, who being vanquish't by the reaſons of the Saints, Yet not willing to Confeſſe it; ſayd vnto him; What need al theſe words and diſputations by which although by Sophiſmes I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I am ouercome, yet my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon remaines vn-conuinced: If then you wil do any good with me, let me ſee a miracle in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what you ſay, and I promiſe you I wil turne to your opiniion; the Saint accepted of the condition, and confident that the Authour of the verity would not be wanting to the confima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, he bid the Heretick
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:95:189"/>(to conuince him the more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently) name himſelfe what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle he deſired should be done; and he anſwered him, he had a mule at home, which he would keepe faſting three whole dayes, and then procure him in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick market place, where let one of your Preiſts be (ſayd he) with your God in the Sacrament, and if the mule refuſe to eate of the oates I shal offer him, to adore him there, I wil promiſe you I wil be ready to adore him alſo; This was done, and at the fame of this, there being a mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of people from al parts to behold what the iſſue of it would bee; The day aſſigned being come, &amp; al things ordered as was agreed vpon, the mule at ſight of the oates euen wild with famine
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:95:190"/>running towards them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken ſome of them in his mouth, was in this manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured by the Saint with the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament in his hand: <hi>In the name of God</hi> (ſayd he) <hi>whom I although vnworthy hold heer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt my hands, I command thee to leaue that provinder, and come preſently hither to adore and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him:</hi> When behold a moſt ſtupendious miracle, the beaſt not only forbore to eate any more, but euen let fal out of his mouth that prouinder it had, and ran preſently bowing downe the head, and on his knees adored the holy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament, to the vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keable ioy and alacrity of al the Catholicks, the Hereticks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and the conuerſion of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:95:190"/>the man.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Friday</hi> being the day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the memory of our Sauiour in particular by reaſon of his death and paſſion; I would aduiſe the deuout Chriſtian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his ordinary deuotions in honour of his fiue precious wounds to make fiue reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which can not but be very meritorious and acceptable to the Maieſty of Alm.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING ſpoken of the adoration of our B.

This article of faith is confirmed and ratified by many Councels, and laſtly by the Councel of Trent in the 25. Section, where Angels and Saints are declared honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:95:191"/>with the reuerence of <hi>Dulia</hi> proper and appropriated vnto them.</p>
               <p>On the dayes then when any Saints are to be honoured; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialy the more principally ſort of them, we are to do it with the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſaid reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. On ſimple feaſts and thoſe of leſſer obligation, it may ſuffice before we go to bed, to incline only once or twice in their reuerence; and when 'tis the feaſt of thoſe to whom we haue any particular deuotion, or whom we haue choſen for Patron or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, we ought with more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to honour them more or leſſe according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion &amp; affection of euery one.</p>
               <p>Let al thoſe then who deſire with due reuerence to honour thoſe Saints, to whom they are
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:95:192"/>deuoted, accuſtome themſelues before they goe to bed, to make profound reuerence vnto them, imagining the while them really preſent, and beholding what they do; for ſo, although corporally they be not there, yet ſpiritually they are, and both wel know and vnderſtand what is done in their honour there, and haue a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care and protection of thoſe that are deuoted vnto them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually procuring for them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and aſſiſtances from Alm. God; &amp; this verity is Orthodox, confirmed and approued by many Councels, and holy Doctours.</p>
               <p>Now for the Saints Founders of Religious Orders, which by excellence are called Patriarcks, becauſe as Abraham (for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple) was ſtiled by that name for that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:95:192"/>ſo many people deſcended from him; ſo from them ſo many Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious are propagated in the Church: Of this ſort is S. Benet, S. Auguſtine, S. Francis, and S. Dominick, and of later-yeares S. Ignatius, &amp;c. Al which are to be had in higheſt veneration by thoſe of their holy Orders, not only on the particular dayes when their feaſts are honoured; but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day of the yeare beſides; and that Religious man who deſires to augment in him the deuotion: he hath to the Founder of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhould do wel, to aſſigne a particular day of the week for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring him, &amp; that Wedneſday in particular, as the moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for this effect; when with ſome extraordinary deuotion of faſting, praying, reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing him,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:95:193"/>and the like, he is to procure to honour him more particularly &amp; referr vnto that end al which he doth that day, which finally hath reference al vnto the honour of our Sauiour Chriſt, and to imploy ſome houres of the day in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the particular vertues of that Bleſſed Saint.</p>
               <p>It is the general doctrine of the learned, that the Founder of each Religious Order hath a particular care not only of the Order in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but alſo of each Religious in particular (more or leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their merits are) and that they aſſidually defend them, ſtrengthening their forces, and weakening the enemies who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne and fight againſt them. Of which great priuiledge and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue Brother Leo in particular
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:95:193"/>had an excellent reuelation, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of holy S. Francis, which I wil heer recount.</p>
               <p>S.

God to make him ſo happy, that once more in this life he might enioy the happy aſpect againe of his beloued Maiſter, and iterating his petition both earneſtly &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; it pleaſed Alm. God; that one day he being retired into a ſolitary place, he beheld S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis appearing vnto him in a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge myſterious ſhape al ſhining with glorious light, but for the reſt
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:95:194"/>winged with golden wings and tallonted both hands and feete with Eagles clawes; The Brother tranſported with ioy al ſight of him, was running to embrace and kiſſe his hands and feete, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying in what ſtrange equipage they were, he al amazed deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Saint, the reaſon why he appeared in that ſort: the Saint anſwered againe, vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d theſe are no other then markes of the affection I beare my Order and the Religious thereof; and theſe do ſignifie, that amongſt al the other riche prerogatiues his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty hath honoured me withal ſince my arriuing into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, one is the authority &amp; power to vindicat my Religious from their neceſſities, and defend them from any aduerſity that preſſes
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:95:194"/>them, as often as with confidence they invoke my aide; and theſe wings and tallons now I haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, to ſignify my readines and promptitud in ſuccouring mine, and the force and violence with which I oppugne al thoſe who iniure them.</p>
               <p>Good reaſon then haue the Children of this great Pattiarcke to reioice on earth, for hauing ſo powerful a protector of him in heauen, ſo louing a father, and ſo careful an Aduocate; I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe them to be aſſidual in honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him with thoſe reuerences of which we haue ſpoken; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulary to ſalute him euery day with fiue times bowing their knees vnto the ground in honour of the fiue wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds ſo miraculouſly impreſt vpon him while he liued,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:95:195"/>reioycing and congratulating with him for ſo highe and ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime a dignity; It being no doubt one of the moſt acceptable deuotions we can exhibit vnto him now he is in heauen.</p>

In conformity, to which we find it in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferently vſed for either; as where it is ſayd that the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lits <hi>adored</hi> both their king &amp; God; <hi>they bowed downe,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God, and afterwards their King.</hi> So the Children of Iſrael adored their brother Ioſeph then Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of AEgypt; <hi>&amp; after his brothers had adored him,</hi> &amp;c. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Doctours both ancient &amp; moderne haue diſtinguished it into three ſeueral ſpecies of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; <hi>Latria, Dulia,</hi> and <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulia;</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> being exhibited on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto God himſelfe, as a ſouue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine kinde of adoration, only fitted to the ſoueraine power he hath; with the <hi>ſecond</hi> we honour Saints and Angels; And as for the <hi>third,</hi> it appertaines to the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:95:197"/>B. Virgin alone, and vnto her who ſurpaſſeth in excellence both Angels and al reſt of Saints beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des; and of this in the precedent Chapters we haue diſcourſ't at large.</p>
               <p>In breefe then we eſtablish this concluſion: we are to adore An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men deſeruing it; and this is an Article of faith (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Suares) defined by Pope Felix the firſt of that name in the Councel at Rome, the 7. th. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; And S. Auguſtine ſpeaking of the B. Apoſtle S. Peter ſayes: <hi>An infinit number of the beleeuers adored the B. Fisher Peter.</hi> And in another place: <hi>Men merit</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>to bee reſpected and honoured, and to ſay more, adored.</hi> Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable vnto which verity we finde in the holy ſcriptures many men
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:95:197"/>to haue adored the Angels; as Abraham in particular three, and Lot his brother two. So <hi>Ioſua</hi> the famous Captaine of the Iſraelits adored one, who appeared to him in the likenes of a man; <hi>he'fel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on the ground, and adored him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then we really owe them this honour, let vs endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to diſcharge the debt, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring them with ſuch frequent genuflexions, as our owne deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shal incline vs to, as the moſt excellent Creatures of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ful of grace and glory and participant of the diuine nature.</p>
               <p>And amongſt al the motiues to incite vs to it, me thinkes one of the moſt principal should bee, the ſublime priuiledges they are endowed withal in heauen. For if we conſider their liues, we finde
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:95:198"/>them to be incorruptible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal: of their nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they haue no body, and conſequently are aboue al its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and are ſuperiour to al thoſe miſeries and afflictions to which we are ſubiect heere. If we caſt our eyes on the agility and promptitud with which they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, we shal ſee nothing in this vniuerſe to equal them, and euen the heauens themſelues come short of them, whoſe velocity we ſo much admire. But what should we ſay of the capacity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of their vnderſtanding, that comprehend perpetually without diſcourſe, and from the firſt inſtant of their Creations had a perfect knowledge of al na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things? What of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and efficacy of their Wil,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:95:198"/>wherwith they wil earneſtly, what ſoeuer they deſire, and are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocable in al that they intend? what of the tenacity of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which neuer forgetts what it hath ſtored once? laſtly what of their ſo great and vnmeaſurable power, that one Angel only in a night ſlew one hundred eighty fiue thouſand of the Aſſyrians? and which is more, that one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can turne with an incredible facility the <hi>primum Mobile,</hi> in compariſon of which al this great machin of earth and water is but like a litle point: and that with ſo euen and regular a motion, that in ſo many thouſand yeares was neuer obſerued the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorder or deuiation. And to omitt nothing that may conferr vnto their honour, I wil heer declare
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:95:199"/>the ſeueral orders of them and numbers which they containe.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Hierarchy then: which is that which receiues im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly the ſplendors and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations from Alm. God, there are three Quiers or Orders, to witt, the Seraphins, Cherubins, and Thrones: of which the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins in ſeruor of charity excel the reſt, the Cherubins in pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud of knowledge, and the Thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in ſeeing fartheſt into God the cauſes and origins of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine effects. In the ſecond Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy are likewiſe three other Quiers or Orders to wit, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Vertues, and Powers; In the third, three others, to wit, Principalityes, Archangels, and Angels. For we muſt vnderſtand, though this name of Angel be
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:95:199"/>common to al, yet in a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, to thoſe of the third quire, it properly ſignifying a meſſinger, and ſo is rather a name of Office then nature, which becauſe they are more ordinarily delegated to that ſunction then the reſt, hath a more particular reference vnto them.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that S. Paul ſpeaking of the ſuperiour Quires of them ſayes: that they are miniſters of God, imployed for thoſe who are to participat of his inheritance: which words of his S. Denis the Areopagite his diſciple, S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, S. Iohn Damaſcene, and S. Thomas interpret thus: not that he meanes the firſt Quire of them are imploy'd immediatly with men; but the ſecond receiue their
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:95:200"/>intelligence from them; the third of them and of what they are to do. Yet S. Gregory Nazianzen, S. Cyprian S. Chryſoſtom, S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, and many other Doctors, are of opinion, that although or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily they are not imploy'd about the affaires of men, as the inferior are, Yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding when any important buſines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them is to be done, Alm. God ſometymes imployeth them: as a Seraphin to purity the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſays lipps; the Archangel Raphael to accompany yong To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias on his way; the Archangel Gabriel to Annuntiat to the B. Virgin the diuine myſtery of our Sauiours Conception; and laſtly, S. Michael in a particular manner to haue a care and protection of the Church,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:95:200"/>
Now if the diuiſion of their quires and Orders be ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and great, farr more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and great is the number of them, which none can truely tel but Alm. God himſelfe, although many haue giuen a gueſſe therat. Certaine it is, that if God for the Conueniency thereof hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed this inferiour world with ſuch infinit diuerſity of creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res corporal, much more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly would he ſtore the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour world with creatures im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material and ſpiritual, inuiſible and incorruptible, ſuch as the Angels are.</p>
               <p>And for their Number, I leaue you to coniecture it, from this Conſideration how this world in compariſon of that, is no more than the Center point is in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:95:201"/>of an infinit Circonference and conſequently how many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants muſt goe more to that then this. And ſo Iob ſpeaking of them ſayes: <hi>There is a multitud of his ſoldiers:</hi> And if the Maieſty of a King on earth, is declared moſt in the number of thoſe that ſerue and fight for him, as the Holy Ghoſt in expreſſe termes affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: <hi>The dignity of a king Conſiſts in the multitud of his people, and in the ſmal number of them the Princes shame.</hi> We muſt needs conclude then to be infinit, in reſpect of the Maieſty of Alm. God. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their number in particular, I wil heer declare what Albertus Magnus amongſt other Doctors hath left written of them. She ſayes then, that there are nine Quires of Angels, and that euery
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:95:201"/>quire hath its Legions, that each. Legion of them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines. 6666. and that there are, as many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in euery Quire as there are Angels in a Legion. Others ſaye, there are ten times more in the ſecond Quire then in the firſt in the third then in the ſecond, and ſo with proportion to the higheſt Quire. So as there being, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the Quire of Angels fower and forty millions, foure hundred thirty fiue thouſand, fiue hundred fifty ſixe Angels, that of Archangels hath ten tymes as many; that of the Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as farr in number exceeds them, &amp;c. Who is not ready to iſſue out of himſelfe, with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſuch infinit multitud exalted by Alm. God for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and our benefit? and who
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:95:202"/>entring into himſelfe againe, can comprehend with what profound reuerence they ſerue his diuine Maieſty of which Iob ſpeaking ſayes: <hi>Thoſe who moue the heauens, bow downe and lye proſtrate before him, and the Pillars of heauen trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at his ſight.</hi> So the Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaking of their readines &amp; promptitud in executing his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſayes of them: And yee Angels praiſe our Lord, who are ſo powerful in performing of his wil, and obey ſo faithfully the voice of his commands. And this is the firſt reaſon, that ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite vs to render them ſeruice and reuerence.</p>
               <p>The ſecond yet is more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that is, our many obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to them for their many good Offices don vs perpetually,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:95:202"/>which although it be at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Alm. God, and they in their performance are but his Miniſters; yet they being deriued vnto vs by them, from the ſoueraigne fountaine from whence al our good proceeds, we are to receiue them from them moſt gratefully, &amp; with a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgement. I wil not inlarge this Chapter to ſumme them vp, but remit the Reader to the holy Scripture, where they ſhal find them recorded both very particularly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. Now let vs come to the exerciſe of this deuotion. To render them then that honour which is due to the aboundance and ſublimity of Glory which they haue, in being of ſo neere acceſſe to God the fountaine of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:95:203"/>it al, and participating by it of his diuine nature; we are (to do wel) for to retire our ſelues, and there recollecting vs in the interiour of our ſoule, (exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding al earthly cogitations) to be the whilſt the more in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, we are to imagine their Orders and array, their beauty, ſublimity, riches, ſplendour, and in fine their glory and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfection, and thus diſcourſe within our ſelues: this Quire then the reſt, is more ſublime, this more ſpecious, this fuller of merit and luſter, with a thouſand other conſiderations on a ſubiect of ſuch great worth and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud. Then we are to ſalute them troup after troup, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment ful of reuerence and reſpect, making the longer ſtay,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:95:203"/>where our deuotions ſhal detaine vs longeſt, either amongſt the Seraphins, Cherubins, &amp;c. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating with them their great ſplendours and prerogatiues; and afterwards proſtrating our ſelues before the throne of God, we are to praiſe and render him humble thankes for creating creatures ſo perfect and excellent for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and the honour of his Court.</p>
               <p>The like manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we may vſe in honouring the Saints, as Patriarcks Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſours. Virgins, and the like, eſpecially thoſe which we are moſt deuoted vnto, addreſſing vs to them, by the foreſayd acts of congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and adoring them, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king delight to maintaine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them in our harts,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:95:204"/>communicating with them our affaires and neceſſities, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly commending our ſelues to their prayers: ſeeing (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Doctours affirme) they behold in God, and know al our neceſſities, our moſt ſecret wishes, and the affections of our harts, and al the reuerences and actions we doe in honouring them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I thinke it fitt, and would counſel it to the zealous Catholicke, who deſires to go on, in honouring theſe B. ſpirits; to preſcribe to himſelfe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number in reuerencing them; as that of Nine in honour of the nine Quires of them, &amp;c. But becauſe the holy Church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes reuerent mention of three of them in particular, S. Michael, S.
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:95:204"/>Gabriel, and S. Raphael; I would conſel to begin with them: As firſt, with S. Michael, who is Prince of al the reſt, ſeeing as Laurentius Iuſtinianus ſayes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are to honour al the ſouldiers of heauen, yet their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deſerues more peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, for the greatnes &amp; high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his qualityes and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, his inuincible force, the ſingular loue which his ſouerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne Emperour beares him, and finally for his fidelity to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and admirable valour; of which he gaue ſo rare proofes in that great battaile he fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Infernal enemy and al his followes. And certainly with good cauſe doth the holy Church ſo reuerence him, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him for her protectour, and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:95:205"/>one that receaues into his patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage al departed ſoules that die in grace and the fauour of God almighty. Next S. Gabriel, as he that had that happy embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage committed to his charge of Annunciating to the B. Virgin the Incarnation of the ſonne of God. Thirdly, S. Raphael the guide &amp; defender of Pilgrims in this life, as he did by the yong Tobias in al his pilgrimage.</p>
               <p>If thou be then deſirous to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme theſe deuotions, and haſt retired they ſelfe to performe them the better, putting thy ſelf in their prefence (as it were) who really behold at al times what we doe; thou art twelue ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to bow downe and do reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence honouring by the firſt Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration S. Michael, General of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:95:205"/>the hoſt of heauen; by the ſecond, S. Gabriel, who brought the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage of our ſaluation; by the third, S. Raphael, and by the reſt in their ſeueral Orders the nine Quires of Angels, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the better performance thereof, I wil heer ſet downe a moſt eaſy method (for al ſorts of people,) of this deuotion.</p>

So likewiſe they may, more to facilitat the memory, begin with the lower Quires, and ſo by degrees aſcend to thoſe more highe. And if there be any yet ſo wanting memory that they cannot remember this, it may ſuffice they make nine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerences, with intention to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour each Quire of Angels by it, without pronouncing any word at al, but only imagining with
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:95:208"/>themſelues; now I honour the firſt Quire, now the ſecond, and now the third, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now it reſts, that we aſſigne one day of the weeke for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this Deuotion; and what more proper the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Church hath appointed to honour the B.

                  <p>And becauſe Pſalmody is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding grateful to them, (:if it be accompanied with due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit;) thoſe who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that laudable exerciſe, are to endeauour to comport themſelues with al due reuerence
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:95:208"/>and deuotion; imagining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in preſence of the Angels while they are performing it: <hi>I wil ſing Pſalmes in the preſence of Angels, I wil adore in his holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and praiſe his holy name.</hi> And to this accords wel that which we reade of S. Bernard in the hyſtory of the illuſtrious men of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtercians,</hi> how he ſawe the B. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, while <hi>Te deum</hi> was ſung, to goe from one Quire to another, encouraging the Religious to ſing it with feruour and deuotion: Another tyme he ſawe them bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily writing downe what the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious pronounced, thoſe in golden better which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with force of ſpirit and from the hart, thoſe in ſiluer which were vttered with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but not ſuch feruour as the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:95:209"/>former were; thoſe in inke, which proceeded from them with a litle admixture of diſtraction; and thoſe finally in puddle-water, which were pronounced without al ſenſe of deuotion. Moued then, by this example, and knowing that the B.

Happy and thrice happy are they who shal ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, ſince they shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for it, not only by the Angels interceſſions in heauen continually for them; but alſo by their aſſidual aſsiſtance of them heer, from al dangers both of bodily and ghoſtly enemies, til at laſt receiuing vs at the honour

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:95:210"/>in beſtowing them vpon vs; no leſſe admirable is his power in creating them in ſuch innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable multituds, that the very loweſt Quire of them is ſufficient to furnish with Angels guardia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, not only al the men that are, but al that haue been or ſhal be as long as the world ſhal laſt: ſo according to the probable conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the learned, there being a matter now of ſome million million of ſoules in al the world, not only euery one of them hath an Angel guardian, but one ſo particularly vnto himſelf, as he was neuer Guardian to any one before, nor euer ſhalbe to any after him; God whenſoeuer he creates a ſoule, appointing a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Guardian that neuer in that office was imployed before. And
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:95:211"/>who can imagine then, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of millions there muſt be to ſerue for ſo many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of men, that haue been &amp; ſhal be vntil the general Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day? And this opinion is the more probable, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Gods omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which is more illuſtrated thereby, but alſo of a certaine congruency on the Angels part, who if they ſhould not ſuffice in number to afford each one a Guardian, it would follow that the number of men would exceed that of them, which would argue a deficiencie in them, and take from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion by which it is ſuppoſed, that as the Archangels exceed the Angels ten to one, &amp;c. ſo there should be ten times more of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels then of men,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:95:211"/>
The neceſſity we ſtand in of their caeleſtial aide, is great and vrgent; firſt becauſe our ſoules are ſpiritual, and conſequently ſpirits can beſt ſee their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes next becauſe we our ſelues are weake and ignorant of the force and imagination of the Enemy to enſnare and ouercome vs were it not for them; Who watching continually by vs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue al their wayes, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully meete them with preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But heere ſome may obiect, how can they be continually by vs when our Sauiour ſayes, they continually behold the face of Alm. God, in whoſe viſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts their cheiſeſt beatitud: <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li eorum ſemper vident faciem Patris mei qui in caelis eſt.</hi> To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:95:212"/>with S. Gregory, that it is true the Angels are ſtil in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, euen when corporally they are employed elſ-where; elſe we could not reconcile that other place of Scripture with this, where it is ſayed; that God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes them on his Embaſſages heer on earth; ſo as while in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the heauenly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence they are ſtil in heauen, we muſt grant them really the while to be on earth.</p>
               <p>And to incite in vs a greater deuotion towards them, I wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to ſumme vp the many good offices they dayly do vs; which although infinit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, may yet be reduced to three heads. The firſt is; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs from many euident dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, by their careful cuſtody of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:95:212"/>vs, which the holy Prophet teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies where he ſayes: <hi>He hath giuen his Angels charge of thee, to looke to thee in al thy wayes, and beare thee in their handes least thou shouldſt dash thy foote againſt a ſtone.</hi> And heer let each one Cal to minde, how many-fold dangers they haue eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped Heer, one the falling of a houſe vpon his head, which if he had not ſodainly changed his mind, he had gone iuſt vnder it as it did fal; and to whom can he attribute this change of mind, but to his Angel Guardian: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being prepared to goe ſome voyage puts it off, he knowes not why, and after wards vnderſtands that if hee had gone, he had falne into the hands of Pirats or of theeues, and this was the worke of his good Angel alſo; with a
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:95:213"/>hundred others the like. Which the Patriarke <hi>Iacob</hi> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to come from his Angel kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when bleſſing the children of his ſonne Ioſeph he ſayd: <hi>The Angel who hath preſerued me from al euil, bleſſe theſe children,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo did <hi>Iudith</hi> returning victorious from Holofernes campe. <hi>So it hath ſeemed good vnto our Lord</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>whoſe Angel hath guarded me, in going forth, in remayning there, and in returning backe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though the B. Angels care extends it-ſelfe as wel vnto the bad as to the good, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they more ſpecially im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part their aide vnto the iuſt; as the Pſalmiſt teſtifies where he ſayes: <hi>Qui habitat in adiutorio Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſsimi,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who dwelleth in the aide of the Higheſt, remaynes in the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:95:213"/>protection of the God of heauen:</hi> And there is no doubt, but God hath a moſt particular care of the iuſt and vertuous, and conſequently commends them in a moſt deare manner vnto their Angels Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; as may be gathered out of that paſſage of holy Scripture: <hi>He hath giuen his Angels charge of you,</hi> &amp;c. As if he would ſaye, thoſe who are Gods faithful ſeruants, may goe ſecurely in the midſt of dangers, for God hath giuen the charge vnto his Angels to haue eſpecial care of them. Whether they ſleepe, or wake, they need not feare; for being in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular protection of God and their Angel Guardian, it may be ſayd vnto them: <hi>They may walke on the Aſpick and the Baſiliske, and tread the Lion &amp; Dragon vnder their feet.</hi>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:95:214"/>What a wonderful priuiledge is this? to be able to contemne the Aſpick and Baſiliſke, which euen kils with its ſight, and the Lion and Dragon the moſt formidable of al other beaſts? and who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraynes the killing lookes of the one, or cohibits the others fiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenes, but only our Angel Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian?</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> benefit which we receiue from them, is the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Counſel and aduice, which they are ſtil infuſing into our minds. And of this we haue a cleere example in the Angel that accompanied Tobias on his way, and gaue him ſuch wiſe and prudent inſtruction, in point of his mariage, how he should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelfe with his new ſpouſe for to eſcape the fate
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:95:214"/>which had ſent ſo many of her husbands vnto death: as namely, that he was to begin his mariage (quite contrary to the cuſtome now a dayes) with watchings, prayers, and deuotion. In the like manner an Angel Guardian is continually ſuggeſting whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome counſels vnto vs, now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring vs from euil, now inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs to good, which without their incitement we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doe: now propoſing to vs the example of our Sauiour Chriſt before our eyes, now of ſome other Saint, for to awake our Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; then inflaming our wils to embrace the occaſion of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating them; laſtly, they go ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes ſpurring vs on by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the mercy of Alm. God; &amp; now refrayning vs againe
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:95:215"/>by that of his iuſtice and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſo euer directing euen our courſe betwixt heauen and hel, that neyther the conſideration of the one extoll vs too much, nor the other too much depreſſe vs.</p>
               <p>And tel me now, haue you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer experienced, when you were about to committ any greeuous crime, a remorſe of Conſcience, and certaine shrinkings backe, and bidding vs forbeare? and what should this be; but our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel Guardian, appointed to this office by Alm. God? Beſides, how oftentymes may we imagine God offended with our crimes, to haue been in mind to haue pluck't vs from the earth, like vnfruitful trees, and throwne into the fire of Eternal hel, had it not been for their interceding
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:95:215"/>for vs? like him who ſayd vnto the man in the parable, being minded to pluck vpp his figg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, which for three yeares he had obſerued never to haue borne fruit that he should haue, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience with it another yeare, and after he had cultiuated it, if it bore not fruit he should doe his pleaſure with it; The Doctours in explicating this paſſage ſaye: We are theſe vnfruitful trees, Alm. God the Lord of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, and our Angel Guardian he that intercedes and vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes for vs: Imagine then how much we contriſtat him if we be wanting vnto his promiſes and to the hopes which he conceiues of vs</p>
               <p>The third and laſt benefit for which we are liable to our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:95:216"/>Guardian is, that he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies vs perpetually from the houre of our birth to the final pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of our liues, and neuer aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons vs euen when we are aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by euery one beſides; and ſuch a freind we haue of him, as the world hath none; For behold a beautious Virgin in the flower of her yeares and pride of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how many, ſeruants she hath that make court to her, and with what obſequiouſnes they obſerue her, til that flower fading, and the winter of her yeares and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes of age falne on her beauty once, they fal of as faſt, and she is left only to ſolitud and neglect, who was before the only one fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and to whom al reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects were payd. Whereas our good Angel is ſo conſtant a freind
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:95:216"/>of ours, as no change of fortune qualifyes, or time makes vs goe leſſe with him, but he is euer the ſame, and neuer alters in loue vnto vs, euen when he ſees vs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God and man; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this, is, becauſe he knowes not as yet the final reprobation of him whom he hath in charge, otherwiſe he would not haue ſuch care of wicked men, as moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it he hath.</p>
               <p>Another benefit for which we ſtand infinitely obliged vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that they carefully preſent our Petitions vnto Alm. God our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, watchings, and al our good works we doe; which by thoſe words of the Angel to Tobias is rendred euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: <hi>When thou prayedſt with teares, and buriedst the dead, when thou didſt leaue thy repaſt, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:95:217"/>didſt conceale the dead by day in thy houſe; and didst bury them by night, I offred thy prayer vnto our Lord.</hi> And this by that myſtical ladder of Iacob was vnderſtood, where the Angels were ſeen aſcending and deſcending, betwixt heauen and earth, to ſignifie the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual commerce they haue with either for our avayle, not by local motion, but by a farr more ready way. Sometimes one Angel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to Alm. God the generous victory of this man ouer his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; another ſayes, behould, O Lord, the profitable vſe which this ſoule makes of that precious bloud you ſhed for it vpon Mount Caluary, and of al thoſe other graces which with ſo liberal a hand you haue beſtowed on it; A third cries out, Good Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:95:217"/>this charitable perſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes beſtowed vpon you in the perſon of the poore, or theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout teares ſhed only out of an affectionat loue of you; Another finally preſent the oblation of this good Religious perſon in wholy renouncing al worldly commodityes, or this Preiſts pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and zeale, in offering vp the holy ſacrifice of the Maſſe, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating our Sauiours Paſſion; and this the Canon of the Maſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes ſaying: <hi>Iube haec perferri per manus ſancti Angeli tui in ſublime Altare tuum in conſpectu diuinae ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtatis tuae:</hi> Command this to be carryed by the hand of your holy Angel to your ſublime Altar in the fight of your diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And as they are aſſiſtant to vs
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:95:218"/>during our liues, ſo at our deaths are they much more powerfully defending vs from al the aſſaults of the Infernal Enemy; as teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies B. Aloyſius Gonzaga of the Societie of Ieſus, in that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout meditation of our Angel Guardian where hee ſayes, that our Angel Cuſtos at the time of our death is moſt diligent in aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting vs againſt the Enemy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing vs cheifly from thoſe two ſinnes which are moſt incident to men in that article of time, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and deſpaire, to the end that making heer a happy end they may repaire with them to heauen, vnto their euerlaſting habitation; And in proſecuting his diſcourſe he ſayes, that as ſoone as the ſoule once is free from the captiuity of the body,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:95:218"/>its Angel preſently conducts it to the Tribunal of Alm. God, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating and encouraging it on the way, to put its cheifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the merits of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred bloud of our Sauiour Chriſt; and if it chance (the better to be purified from its ſinnes) to be adiudged vnto the purging fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, he viſits it often there, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts it, brings it the ſuffrage and ſuccour of thoſe prayers and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which are offred for it in the other world, and encourages in middeſt of its ſuffrances, with the hope it can not be long in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and in fine when the time is expired, he conducts it out, and al bright and purified leades it vnto heauen, and in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye, preſents it vnto Alm: God to receaue from him
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:95:219"/>the Crowne of eternal beatitud, prepared from al eternitie for thoſe, who heer ſighe after it in this vale of teares. O happy and a thouſand tymes happy is that ſoule, which hauing been faithful to its Creator, and pliant to his hand to be ledd whither ſoeuer his leaſt motion carried it, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his good Angel for guide leauing the world ful of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his example arriues at laſt vnto that Kingdome of eternal felicity, where with God and his Saints it shal for euer raigne.</p>
               <p>But now touching the practiſe of this particular deuotion to our Angel Guardian; firſt being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that we are committed to his Regencie, and that ſo noble and excellent a creature, as al the eloquence of the world rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:95:219"/>then add to its co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, vouchſafes to keep vs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall company, and defends vs from al euil, with his careful wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings &amp; his comfortable aduiſe, we are on our parts to endeauour a requital: Firſt, by comporting our ſelues with al deuotion and due reſpect vnto his preſence and next honouring him with al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent honour. Let vs then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if we ſtood perpetually in the ſight of ſome earthly Prince or Monarke; how careful we ſhould be ſo to compoſe our outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, as might render vs moſt grateful in his ſight; &amp; with how much more care and diligence ought we in the preſence of our Angel Guardian to comport our ſelues? Heare what S. Bernard ſayes in explication of theſe
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:95:220"/>words: <hi>For he hath giuen his Angels charge ouer thee to guard thee in al thy wayes,</hi> &amp;c. O mortal man, ſayes he, what reuerence, what deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confidence art thou to conceiue in thy breaſt from theſe comfortable words of the Royal Prophet; reuerence in ſtanding in preſence of thy Angel, deuotion for his loue of thee, &amp; confidence for his care. Be therefore vigilant neuer to exceed the bonds of thy reſpect while theſe holy ſpirits are alwayes in thy ſight by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Alm. God himſelfe attending them thy preſeruation in al thy wayes, and whereſoeuer thou art, either in priuat or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique, be alwayes careful neuer to commit that indecency before him, which before me thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not doe. Thus S. Bernard in
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:95:220"/>his deuout and pious manner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to honour them with theſe reuerences we haue formerly treated of, which may be beſt performed when into priuat we haue retir'd our ſelues; eſpecially before we retire our ſelues to reſt with a profound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination we are to ſay, <hi>Angele Dei, qni Cuſtos es mei,</hi> &amp;c. beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to keep vs in our ſleepe from the aſſalts of the Enemy, that euer watches to harme and miſchiefe vs; ſo when we awake, we are to commend our ſelues vnto them that day following, &amp; whatſoeuer buſines we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, that it may ſort a wiſhed concluſion; and we ſhould do wel often to commend vnto them in ſome vocal manner a deuout con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of our hart in our occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:95:221"/>neceſſityes, beſeeching them to aſſiſt vs in the mannage of this or that particular affaire.</p>
               <p>This deuout cuſtome had one Alexander Luzaqua an Italian Gentleman of a moſt holy and vertuous life; that as often as he ſaluted any man, he mentally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that reuerence vnto his Angel Guardian whom he ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and an excellent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was, to thinke a celeſtial ſpirit, more worthy the ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then an earthly worme. Let vs imitate this deuotion, and in ſaluting any ſay thus in our minds I offer this reuerence to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel Guardian that attends vpon him or he whom I ſalute. And moſt happy it wil be for vs if we do ſo, for by this meanes we shal indeare our ſelues in the loue and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:95:221"/>care of thoſe B. ſpirits, who can do more for our real aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and good, then al the world beſides.</p>

               <p>We haue an example of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout Religious woman recounted by F.

God beſtowes vpon the leaſt good work of ours, is ſo exceſſiue great, as if it were putt to my choice, I would returne euen from the ioyes of heauen vnto the earth againe, and ſuffer al my former afflictions, only to recite
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:95:224"/>one <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> that returning thence againe, I might acquire a new merit by it in heauen, and this, although I were not certaine to ſay it without tepidity or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, ſo that I were but in grace the while, and free from al mortal ſinne. And if this holy Religious woman would haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her ſelf to ſuch cruel paine and ſufferances, only for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſo ſmal an act, how great ſhal their merit be, who exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelues in this deuout exerciſe of reuerencing her, being one of the greateſt &amp; moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſeruices which a Chriſtian can render vnto the Mother of God.</p>

We muſt then procure to reuerence him ſo, as theſe exteriour deuotions may proceed from the redundancy of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:95:226"/>the Interiour; to which effect be fore we put in practiſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid reuerences, we are to fixe our interiour eyes on the Maieſty of Alm.

               </p>
               <p>And to acquit our ſelues the better of this deuotion, we are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially euery morning when we riſe, as at night when we retire
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:95:227"/>to reſt, moſt profoundly to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence this our Alm.

               <p>And this let vs do, as often as we bow our knees in reuerencing Alm. God, accompanying it ſtil with ſome interiour act of the loue of him, an act, which no creature in heauen and earth can truly imagine the excellency of it; being an operation which God continually is exerciſing in himſelfe, to wit of ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencie in his infinit good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:95:227"/>whence doth proceed the loue of it which muſt likewiſe be infinit; Theſe acts of loue then let vs endeauour to ſtirr vp in our ſelues, and aſſure our ſelues that the leaſt of them is ſufficient to rayſe a ſoule to a moſt highe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection.</p>
               <p>As witneſſeth this ſtory extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of the ſecond part of the Chronicles of the Friers Minors. A certaine Religious matron be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in viſion thirty Religious of the Conuent of Paris al depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this life at once, whereof fiue only were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, the reſt went al imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to heauen; &amp; one amongſt the reſt had his place aſſigned him amongſt the Seraphins: She being returned from her viſion and aſtonished thereat, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:95:228"/>to the Guardian of the Friars where ſhe liued, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto him al that she had ſeen; who like a prudent man, aduiſed her, to beſeech Alm. God in continuation of his former fauour to reveale vnto her the name of him who was ſo highly aduanced aboue the reſt; therby more particularly to know the truth of the viſion: she did ſo, &amp; it was reuealed vnto her that his name was <hi>Venance;</hi> here-vpon the Guardian diſpatcht an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe to Paris to informe him of thoſe who were lately dead in that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uent; whoſe nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber being giuen him vpp, he found them exactly to agree with that of the Viſion; and that this <hi>Venance</hi> was only a ſimple lay Brother amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the reſt, whoſe Office was to haue
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:95:228"/>care of the Friars habits, and mend them when they were torne; which it ſeemes he had executed with ſuch charity, as he had merited by it that highe place in heauen.</p>
               <p>Now if this good Religious man, in exerciſing this ſlight and manual Office could merit ſo high a degree of glory, thoſe who are exerceſed in this Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical deuotion which we treat of, if they do it with that attention as they ought, how farr more high an one muſt they needs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by it? And for our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menr, it were good to conſider, how farr more profitably we may be exerciſed in it, then the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels whoſe continual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment it is: for they with al that they can do, can never adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:95:229"/>higher by it, an Angel can neuer become an Archangel, an Archa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel can never ſitt equal with the Thrones, nor a Cherubin in fine be embraced with the fire of a Seraphin; whereas we may not only accumulat merits ſo, to rayſe vs from men to Angels, but euen ſurpaſſe them themſelues, and being eleuated higher then Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Thrones, become euen equal with the Seraphins: and by this only exerciſe may al this be effected.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe may we apply this deuotion to the honour of <hi>Dulia</hi> proper to the Saints, by the only turning of the minds intention, and this more particularly on the dayes wheron they are honoured, and their feaſts are celebrated; when beſides theſe external reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:95:229"/>we are to procure to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them from our hearts, by elicit acts from thence of congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulaion for their felicities, and thankſgiuing vnto Alm. God for hauing predeſtinated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from al eternity to that high dignitie to which he hath promoted them, &amp; to which they haue arriued, by ſo many vertuous and meritorious wayes, leauing to vs their Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to trace their glorious foot ſteps after them; That day like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we are to aſcend in mind to the particular actions of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, conſidering the ardent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this one, this others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found humility, and the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their liues ſhal giue occaſion.</p>
               <p>In concluſion, this aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I wil giue, out of that holy
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:95:230"/>Cardinal Bellarmine touching theſe exteriour reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, to wit, that they are only to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed (whether don in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Alm. God, of his B. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of Angels, or of Saints) by the internal inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of the mind, and the merit and excellency of thoſe they are directed to. As for example, we adore and reuerence Alm. God for the immenſenes of his gratnes and Maiſty, for his infinit goodnes, and for being both our beginning and final end. We honour the Saints, as thoſe who participat of his diuine grace and celeſtial glory; and the B. Virgin, as Mother of Alm. God, and ſurpaſſing in excellency of title, al Creatures both, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth. Conformable to this, we ſee in holy ſcripture,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:95:230"/>how Abraham with the ſame ſort of veneration, bowed downe both to God, Angels, and men, indifferently honouring them according to their dignities; and in this manner we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the holy Scripture when it occurrs to ſpeake in any other paſſage of theſe venerations.</p>

This only is to be noted, that while we honour them, we direct not our reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vnto them, as they are mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially what they are of wood or ſtone, &amp;c. but as they repreſent them whoſe Images they are; it repreſents according to that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient axiome; <hi>the honour of the Image is referred to thoſe whom it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents.</hi> And this the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> inferts where it ſayes: <hi>In the Images, which we honour and fal downe before, we adore Ieſus Chriſt, and reuerence his Saints.</hi> And ſo the 7.

               </p>
               <p>This verity then ſo Catholike, for the better performing this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe we ſhould do wel to procure ſom Picture both deuout and faire, before which we are to do our reuerences (although of this there be no neceſſity;) I ſay faire, for faire obiects do ſooneſt ſtirr vp the affections of the mind; as appeares by that example of S. Bernardine, who while he was but very yong, was ſo taken with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion to a certaine picture of our B. Lady, more comly then the reſt, that he was neuer wel but when he was on his knees before it; and heer it was where he layd the foundation of his ſanctity,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:95:232"/>which afterwards he built ſo high vpon, as it was an admiration to the world.</p>
               <p>Which manner of adoring the B. Virgin in her Images, is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible remedy againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our infernal Enemie; as this following example doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, taken out of S. Iohn Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen by F. Suarez of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Ieſus. There was a deuout Religious man (ſayes he) accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to worſhip the Mother of God in a certaine Image of hers; who being one day fiercely aſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Enemy, with a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous temptation, as he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imploying al his force for the repelling it, the diuel appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him promiſed him, if he would forbeare to honour that Image, he would not only free
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:95:232"/>him from that preſent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but neuer moleſt him with the like againe. But the good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man in defiance of him, fel a freſh to honour it before his face, and the diuel and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both vaniſhed away.</p>
               <p>And a great help it would be to this deuotion, to imagine the B. Virgin the while beholding vs from heauen (as without al doubt ſhe doth) &amp; taking complacence in our honouring her; &amp; to make the Imagination worke the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer, let vs frame a conceipt, that if an earthly Queene ſhould take ſuch delight in being honoured in picture, as she should place her ſelfe where ſhe might behold with what alacrity and affection it were done, and bountiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe whom ſhe ſawe moſt
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:95:233"/>forward in their honouring it; what concourſe would there be by al who deſired to ingratiat themſelues, and indeare their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices to her Maieſty: and if this for an earthly Queene would be don with ſuch forward &amp; greedy deſire, how much more prompt and ready ought we to be, to doe it to pleaſe &amp; gratify the Queen of heauen? which while we doe, deuoutly, we may ſuppoſe her gratiouſly regarding vs, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of each particular action, pointing vs out to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels about her, thus ſuch one doth, and thus ſuch a one, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue a particular care of them to defend them from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and when their ſoules are free from their mortal priſons, be careful to conduct them higher
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:95:233"/>vnto me. Which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed from this enſuing example recounted by F. Razzi a Dominican, in his <hi>Hortulus,</hi> of a certaine Shepheards daughter axceedingly deuoted to the Queen of Heauen, in ſo much as ſeing her picture in an old rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Chappel (one day while she was tending her fathers ſheepe) and much greeuing to ſee it ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, she ſayd: O B. Virgin, were it in my power, this your Image should be in greater vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but what it wants in exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ornament, I deſire my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour deuotion may ſupply; which deſire of hers was ſo grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Queene of Heauen, as minding to reward her for it and her innocent life with an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting crowne of glory, she ſent her firſt a ſicknes the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:95:234"/>of her death, and iuſt as that was ready to approach vnto her. Two deuout Religious men, the one in viſion, the other in prayer, had eyther of them this reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Concerning her; they firſt ſaw a Proceſſion of Virgins richly habited, al shining with glorious light; which paſſing by them, another troupe followed them more riche and glorious then the former, al clothed in white, and laſtly a third whoſe garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tsbeing red, in ornament and beauty farr ſurpaſſed and out-shined al thoſe that went before; in the cloſing of this laſt trayne, a Queene of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Maieſty appeared, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly exceeding al that can be imagined of venerable and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; at the feete of whom thoſe Religious men proſtrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:95:234"/>deſirous of her to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med who she was, she thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them: I am the Mother of God, and al thoſe troupes, you ſee marching before, are thoſe who haue conſeru'd their virginities al their life time; the firſt troupe, not fully reſolued of their courſe of life, haue yet died Virgins, and receiued the reward thereof, the ſecond is of thoſe, who haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated their virginities by vow vnto their heauenly Spouſe; and the laſt, who to the Crowne of virginity haue added the glorious palme of Martyrdome; al which are now attending me to a hamlet heere to receiue the departing ſoule of a poore ſheapardeſſe; whom for her deuotion to me in mine Image, I meane to place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe heauenly Quires,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:95:235"/>and reward her with the glory of an euerlaſting Crowne. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation (it hapened) theſe two Religious men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated each to the other, when inquiring who this poore Shepardeſſe should be, at laſt they were directed to a litle cotage where lay this poore yong Girle vpon a padd of ſtraw, euen ready to breathe her laſt, When ſeeing theſe Religious men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in; Good Fathers (ſayd ſhe) in reward of your charity I would to God I could ſhew you what a glorious Company is heer away<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to beare my ſoule to reſt; &amp; hauing ſayd this, ſhe rendred vp her ſoule into their hands, who willingly receaued it. By which example we may ſee, how accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the B. Virgin are our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerencing her deuoutly in her Images.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:95:235"/>
Now to the end the frequent aſpect of her Images may excite vs frequently to hononr her; I would counſel euery deuout Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke to adorne their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with ſome Image of hers, or procure rather to haue ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table one, which they are neuer to depart withal; In imitation of S. Heduing a Dutcheſſe of Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, who to honour the glorious Mother of God more frequently, would neuer be without her I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in her hand; the two firſt fingers &amp; thumbe of whoſe right hand at the opening of her Tomb ſome fiue and twenty yeares after her deceaſe were found whole &amp; incorrupt, (al the reſt of her body being waſted vnto to bone) hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding betwixt them an Image of the B. Virgin ſo faſt, as neither
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:95:236"/>when she dyed, nor then, could they take it thence.</p>
               <p>So when in any place her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Image occurs vnto our ſight, we are deuoutly to honour it, in vncouering the head, bowing the knee, &amp;c. According as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chreſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were accuſtomed: the like reuerence we are to do when we heare her name pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; a deuotion ſo punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by the ancient Chriſtians, &amp; Saints as S. Gerard Biſhop of Pannonia commanded it through al his Dioceſe.</p>
               <p>And that which we ſayd of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerencing her name, inuites me likewiſe to ſay a word or two of the reuerence we owe to that of our Sauiour Chriſt. Firſt, for the name of the holy Trinity how venerable it is in the holy Church,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:95:236"/>witneſſeth that verſe in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of euery Pſalme: <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Glory to the Father,</hi> &amp;c. in pronouncing of which, al riſe vp and do reuerence, not only the Quires on earth, but alſo in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it-ſelfe; as is manifeſt by that wondrous example recounted by Petrus Damianus. There was a deuout man (ſayes he) who one night, while they were ſinging Matins, rauiſhed in extaſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the B. Virgin accompanied with an infinity of Angels &amp; Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins entring the Church, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Proceſſion vp the high Altar, he ſaw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al kneele down, and whileſt each <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> &amp;c. was ſinging, they al fell proſtrat on their face; who demanding the reaſon of his extraordinary reuerence, it was anſwered him,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:95:237"/>that as often as thatverſe was ſung on earth, they in heauen were particularly touched with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence exhibited vnto the holy Trinity, and reioyced that their ordinary exerciſe in heauen of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring the Al Bleſſed Trinity, was in ſuch vogue on earth.</p>
               <p>And how ſeuerely any irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence vnto this ſacred verſe, is punished by Alm. God, we haue a cleare Example in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part of the Fr. Minors Chronicles, of a Religious man, who for not inclining while this verſe was pronounc't out of a negligent cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome he had gott, was after death punished in this manner; she was punished placed on a moſt highe and narrow pillar, inuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about with ſea, where a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tymes a day and as oft by
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:95:237"/>night, he was condemned, to moſt profound inclination vntil he had ſatisfied for his neglect of them, in the other world. Which punishment being expired, he reuealed vnto one of his fellow Religious, that at euery inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he felt ſuch a horrible feare, as if at the inſtant he had ben fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into hel.</p>
               <p>As for the B. name of Ieſus, there needs no other teſtimony, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to honour it, then thoſe words of holy Scripture where it is ſayd: <hi>That at the name of Ieſus, al knees should bow both in heauen, Earth, and the Infernal deepes below.</hi> So likewiſe do we reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thoſe words of S. Iohns Goſpel <hi>Et Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Caro factum eſt: and the worde was made flesh:</hi> and that other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Nicen Creed: <hi>Et in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnatus
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:95:238"/>eſt, &amp;c.</hi> by which we are reduced to memory of the ſweet goodnes of Alm. God, and his infinit loue; which cauſed him for our ſakes to vndergo ſo many torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; afflictions in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life; and that man were a very monſter of Ingratitud, should he refuſe to honour him for it.</p>
               <p>Admirable truely and worthy the notice of al the world is that hiſtory which Ceſarius an author worthy of credit recounts. There was (ſayes he) a yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a proud and hauty nature, who being preſent once at Maſſe ſung in the Cathedral Church, whilſt al at pronouncing theſe words, <hi>Incarnatus eſt, &amp;c.</hi> bowed downe their knees in humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, he neuer offered to ſtirr or moue him from his ſeate;
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:95:238"/>In punishment of which irreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, it pleaſed Alm. God to permit the diuel preſently to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto him in a moſt horrible and frightful shape, who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him a furious blow on the face, ſayd vnto him; Poore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious man, doſt thou not know that the Eternal God became man for thee? and art thou not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed then to Sitt while others kneele, &amp; beare thy ſelfe ſo high, for whom God ſtoop't ſo lowe? and what art thou more then others or what priuiledge haſt thou aboue thereſt? vngrateful as thou art; if he whom thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect'ſt ſo much, had done but a hundred part ſo much, for me, as he hath done for thee, I would not only bow downe vnto the earth vnto him, but euen vnto
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:95:239"/>gel it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>For the honour which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to Images, hauing by the way ſpoken of it before, I wil heer omit it, and paſſe vnto.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING ſpoken of diuers ſorts of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that which we intend to ſpeak of now, humbly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline our ſelues at euery <hi>Aue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> in ſaying of our Beads, of al others is the moſt excellent, we may gather from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:95:239"/>it ſelfe of Roſary and the Angelical ſalutation.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the Beads or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, its excellency Conſiſts in this, that it is a deuotion wholy compoſed of our Lords Prayer &amp; the Archangels wordes, with and addition of Saint Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths, out of the holy Ghoſpel, &amp;c. vnto which the holy Church hath no deuotion comparable. Then for the number, it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of. 63. <hi>Aue Marias,</hi> being the number of yeares the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin liued on earth, it is both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout and myſterious; wherefore it were good, that in ſaying ouer the Beads, we inclined at euery <hi>Aue Maria</hi> in memory of each yeare of her B. life, and each ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in which she was exerciſed the while; which if it be duely
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:95:240"/>performed, what an excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion muſt it neceſſarily bee, whilſt we commemorat, how she liued an infant, how in womans ſtate, and how al her life in euery age thereof, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral decades of our Beads' vpon euery one, whilſt we make deuout and humble reuerence me thinkes we exceed in deuotion, euen the Angel whom we imitat, for he only once ſaluted her, but we as often as there are Beads in the Roſary, and as oft as we shal ſay them ouer.</p>
               <p>And whilſt we are exerciſed in this deuotion, what do we elſe but compoſe a Garland for our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the Roſes and lillyes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal life, with which after this mortal life we shalbe Crowned, or rather she doth it for vs, to
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:95:240"/>whom we offer vp this our deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as whilſt a certaine deuout Virgin ſaye her Beads, an Angel was obſerued on a goulden thread for each <hi>Aue Maria</hi> to thread a Roſe, for each <hi>Pater noſter</hi> a lilly, which the following Miracle gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues worthy credit vnto, taken out of the third part of the Fr. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors Chronicles, and it is this: A certaine Guardian had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Nouice of his called Lewis Albanois, to ſay euery day his Beads ouer before he eate or drunke. This deuotion! the good Nouice once by chance (hindred by other buſines) did omitt, which the Guardian vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding inſtantly commanded him to performe, it (iuſt when they were then ſitting downe to eate,) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uearely reprehending him for his
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:95:241"/>negligence, the Nouice obeyed, and repayred vnto the Church, where after he had for ſome good ſpace remained, the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ſent one of the Religious to ſeeke him out: who going, found the Nouice on his knees before the highe Altar deuoutly ſaying his Beads, and ſaw an Angel clofe by him threading of roſes and lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes on a golden thread) as we haue ſayd before): wherupon he remaining aſtonished at the thing the Guardian diſpatch't another in ſearch of him, who hauing found him out, ioyn'd with him in aſtonishment at ſo rare a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle; In fine, one in traine of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, being ſent, and none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning thence, the Guardian at laſt with the reſt aroſe, and al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring to the Church, were al
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:95:241"/>witneſſes of the Miracle; In teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of which, after the Angel diſappeared, (which was not til the Nouice had finished his take) the place remaind', for a long while as freshly ſauouring of roſes and lillyes, as if they had growne there.</p>
               <p>For diuers reaſons is this deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Beads to be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem'd, Firſt for that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical ſalutation coſiſts of words inuented firſt in the conſiſtory of the ſacred Trinity, and afterwards pronounced by the Archangel Gabriel one of the chiefeſt in heauen; for which reaſon <hi>Albertus magnus</hi> ſayes on theſe words <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus eſt, &amp;c.</hi> that the Angel ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the B. Virgin with theſe words <hi>Aue gratia plena: hayle ful of grace;</hi> not in his perſon, but
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:95:242"/>of the B. Trinity, Secondly, be cauſe they are words pronounced firſt by one of the higheſt Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, according to S. Gregory the great and diuers others; and certainly there was a congruency in it he ſhould be one of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſt in the Court of heauen, who should be imployed from Alm. God in a buſines of the higheſt Conſequence on earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by reaſon of the obiects dignity, which is the B. Virgin, whoſe ſoueraine greatnes and perfections are farr tranſcending al other Saints.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence and reſpectful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner this heauenly Embaſſage was deliuered her by the Angel Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel, who accompanied with multituds of Angels apparailed
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:95:242"/>in a white veſtment ſett of with shining beames of light, with countenance full of cheere and humble demeanour ſaluted the B. Virgin with the glorious titles of ful of grace, &amp; our Lord being with her, <hi>Aue gratia plena, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus tecum: &amp;c.</hi> ſo as with good reaſon the holy Scripture ſayes, she was troubled at the aſpect of ſo great Maieſty and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and eſpecially at ſo vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed a ſalutation, attributing ſo much honour to her, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity; for (as Lyra wel obſerues) it was that, and not the Angels preſence she was ſo amazed at, for they had often been preſent with her before; but <hi>Aue gratia plena, Dominus tecum,</hi> she had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard before; and ſo the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſayes, she ſtood muſing at
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:95:243"/>that ſalutation, comparing the dignity of it with her owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines (as she imagined) and that high fauour with her low eſtate. The excellency finally of this Angelical Salutation conſiſts likewiſe in this, that it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes al the vertues, graces prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, dignities, and greatneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which God hath aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Bleſſed Mother with al, it comprehending the higheſt and deepeſt myſteries of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and there shining brightly in it the infinit loue and immenſe goodnes of the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne wiſdome and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible omnipotency, of God. Which being ſo, with how much deuotion and reuerence ought the deuout ſeruant, of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to pronounce it, and how
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:95:243"/>high eſteeme are they to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the whilſt of ſo myſterious a prayer? what ſweet reſentments and guſts of Ioy are they to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, while they pronunce theſe words ſo ful of ſweetnes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation? But what should I ſpeake of the dignity thereof, of which the Angels can neuer ſpeake enough.</p>
               <p>Thoſe then, who would deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeed performe this exerciſe, are before they begin their Beads, to imagin the B. Virgin ſeated in a highe Maieſtik throne invironed about with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Angels and Saints, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and reuerencing her; which I magination being framed (as ſoone as we haue been ſpeaking it) they are to begin their beads, making at each a profound reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:95:244"/>in bowing either the head or knee, and let the meditation of their heart accompany their words of the high titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity attributed vnto her therein, and although they reach not fully the ſenſe of the words, yet it wil ſuffice that they keepe the eyes of their I magina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fixt vpon the B. Virgin ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining they ſpeake in perſon to her; which wil much auayle to ſtirr vp in them, a liuely deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this is the aduiſe which Nauarr giues vs in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taryes, to recite with attention the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> and <hi>Aue Maria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides we muſt obſerue, that we are to make our reuerence at pronouncing of theſe words <hi>Aue Maria, &amp;c.</hi> natural reaſon tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs that in pronouncing of
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:95:244"/>the name of thoſe we honour, &amp; giuing them <hi>Al hayle,</hi> we are to make the greateſt demonſtration of Reuerence. And how grateful vnto the B. Virgin this deuotion is, if deuoutly indeed performed, and how it Crownes her as it were with celeſtial honour; we may learne from this Example recounted by the B. Bernardin of Felthe at Verona in publik Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. There was (ſays he) a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout Religious man, who one day ſaying his beads before the high Altar of the Church, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who ſecretly obſerued it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Angels at euery <hi>Aue Maria</hi> he ſayd crowning the B. Virgin with a crown of ſparkling diamonds, which action they ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated at euery bead which he let fal, whilſt others preſented her
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:95:245"/>the whils with ſeueral flowers of lillyes roſes and the like. Which deuout viſion ought to be al of great conſolation to thoſe who are piouſly exerciſed in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE aduiſe of this great Doctour is, to deuide the Beads or Roſary, and ſay them at ſeueral tymes (euen thoſe we are to ſay of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation)
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:95:245"/>now one or two decads, and as many another tyme, more or leſſe as our commodity ſhal ſerue; ſo as there paſſe no houre of the day that may not haue part of our deuotions; and he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Canonical Houres, al which although they integrat one Office, yet the Church deuides them into ſeueral houres, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes ſeueral parts of the day for the reciting them; ſo ſays he, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Roſary be but one prayer, as it were, yet may it be deuided into ſeueral parts to be ſayd at ſeueral tymes.</p>
               <p>And what on excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity is this, for al ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, euen in the midſt of the preſſe of their affaires, to be able to comply with their deuotions, to her, who of al other creatures
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:95:246"/>can beſt proper them; the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant or citizen may ſay his beads, one part as he goes in the ſtreets, the other at his rerurning home, the lawryer in going to the Hal, the Courtier to the Court, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger of diſtraction, or interruption of their deuotions on the way; the Sodaliſts of our Lady whilſt the Sodality is aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, the deuout perſons whilſt they await the beginning of a Maſſe, or returne homewards af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is done.</p>
               <p>And by this deuotion of the Roſary, or any other particular prayer, the pious Catholike rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes a world of good: For firſt he often entertaines diſcourſe with Alm. God and his B. Mother, by their ſeueral prayers, and that in a manner moſt ſuccinct &amp; breife;
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:95:246"/>which is the beſt, if as the ſaying is; <hi>short prayers do ſooneſt penetrat the heauens;</hi> For which reaſon S. Chryſoſtome in one of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, counſels the people of Antioch, rather to the exerciſe of Iaculatory prayers, that is ſhort and often repeated, then to ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and long prayers, for this (ſayes he) ſooneſt begets tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; and he confirmes it from the doctrine of S. Paul, and of our B. Sauiour himſelfe; and this (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Caſſian) was much in vſe with the ancient Fathers of the Deſart. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d good which we reape from it is, that the more ſhort and breefe it is, with the more feruour and attention it is ſaid; for we ſee by daily experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that when we haue much to recite, we make more haſt with it, then
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:95:247"/>when we haue but litle; which haſte takes much away from our feruour and attention.</p>
               <p>The third Good is, that it puts vs more often in memory of the B. Virgin, and conſequently awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes our loue of her, more often too.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, it actuats vs more frequently in theſe Adorations and Reuerences of our ſoueraine Queene &amp; Empreſſe of Heauen.</p>
               <p>Now if by buſines any one be hindered from ſaying their whole Roſary in a day, they may do it in a weeke (in this manner) ſaying each day a ſeueral decad of it, &amp;c. which is ſo facile and eaſy to perſorme, as none in reaſon can excuſe themſelues from it.</p>

Ignatius the Martyr who liued in the Apoſtles time, that he rauiſh't one day in extaſy, beheld two Quires before the Throne of God, one anſwering the other in this manner; and ſo
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:95:248"/>the ancient Hymne of Angels ſayes: <hi>Alternantes concrepando, melos damus vocibus:</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the receiued opinion to bee, that the Angels in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſing in magnifying God and his B. Mother, whom men to their no ſmal ioy and comfort ought to imitat.</p>
                  <p>The manner then to ſay the Beads alternatly, or by turnes, is this; Two, or more, are with their beads in hand to ſay a <hi>Pater noster</hi> firſt vnto themſelues, and then with an audible voyce recite the <hi>Aue Maria gratia plena, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus tecum;</hi> the other anſwers; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus fructus ventris tui I eſus;</hi> when the firſt reſumes agayne, or both may ioyne together and ſay: <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Maria</hi> &amp;c. and ſo forth vnto
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:95:248"/>the end.

To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter then, I wil on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recount a certaine Miracle in confirmation thereof.</p>
                  <p>What tyme the B. Brother Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardin of Felthe preached at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, a certaine noble Matron had this deuotion to teach al her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren daily before they went to ſchoole, to ſay their beads before a certaine Image of the Queene of heauen which ſhe had in her
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:95:249"/>Chamber; now it happened that one of the leaſt of them, one day fel into the Riuer in paſſing ouer a bridge; of which accident the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being aduertiſed, ſhe preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly caſting her ſelf vpon her knees before the Image of our Lady in lifting vp her eyes to heauen, al bedeawed with teares; O mother of God, ſayd she the, vſual hope of the afflicted, if it be your bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wil, ſaue my poore child, if not, your B. wil be done; and concluding with the Angelical ſalutation deuoutly ſayd; she ran to the place where many people were aſſembled to ſaue the child, and was no ſooner arriued at the bridge, but behold she ſaw her child floting vpon the water and calling her by her name; at which much reioicing she cried out, take
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:95:249"/>ſtrong cheere my child, cal vpon the B. Virgin, and my life for yours; when preſently the child was taken vp ſafe, and brought vnto its mother, when embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it; the child, ſaid vnto her its is not to men I owe my deliura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but to our B. Lady, before whoſe Image you ſo often inſtructed me to pray; and therupon it recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto her, how being falne in, she had receiued it in her armes, and bore it aboue the waters; At this, al the Aſſembly moued to deuotion towards the B.

               <p>Neither is it celebrated on earth alone, but the very Angels in heauen do exerciſe it too, as is confirmed by this viſion, recorded by two graue &amp; learned Authors
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:95:251"/>Lanſpergius the Carthuſian, and Bloſius the famous Abbot in his ſpiritual Mirrour, as followeth: The Prior of the Carthuſians at Treuers a very holy man, and one much exerciſed in this deuotion of the Roſary, one day rauiſhed in viſion, (as he was frequently) beheld the glorious Cittizens of heauen, praiſing and bleſſing with ineffable ioy our Lord Ieſus-Chriſt and his B.

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:95:251"/>this deuotion on earth, ſhould obtaine by our Ladyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion a plenary Indulgence of al their faults, with diuers pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges in this life, and more then can be imagined in the next. From whence we may gather the excellency of the Roſary, &amp; how acceptable it is to our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt, to his B. Mother, &amp; al the Court of Heauen. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to endeauour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it with al due reuerence &amp; attention, if we deſire to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teful vnto them, and to haue them propitious vnto vs.</p>
               <p>The whole Roſary conſiſts of fifteene Decads of <hi>Aue Matias</hi> and fifteene <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> that is, a hundred and fiftie <hi>Aue Marias</hi> which admitting of a triple di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, your beads of fiue decads
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:95:252"/>are thoſe, moſt ordinarily in vſe. Now the manner of Meditating on them, the ſeueral myſteries of our Sauiours and B. Ladyes life, is this. On the firſt fiue decads they vſe to meditat the fiue Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful myſteries, to witt, vpon the firſt, the Angelical ſalutation; when the Eternal Word by the holy Ghoſts cooperation, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: Vpon the ſecond decad, the Viſitation of S. Elizabeth: On the third, the Natiuity of our Sauiour Chriſt: On the fourth, the Preſentation in the Temple of our Sauiour Chriſt, where holy Simeon and Anna the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe foretold to his glad mother his future greatnes and miracles, And on the fifth, our B. Ladyes finding her B. Sonne in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſputing with the Doctors.
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:95:252"/>&amp;c. On the fiue next decads, we are to meditat the fiue Dolorous myſteries; The firſt of which is, our B. Sauiours prayer in the Garden, where he fel into that bloudy Agony: The ſecond, the cruel Flagellation, or his whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the Pillar, til he was al goary bloud: The third, the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him with thornes, their ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in his face, buffeting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiling him, and the like: The fourth, the Carrying of the croſſe on his B. shoulders to Mount Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, when his body ſo enfeebled as before, muſt needes ſinke often vnder the heauy waight: The fifth, his Crucifixion, or nayling vpon the Croſſe, with vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable cruelty, and indignity.</p>
               <p>On the laſt 5. Decads we are to Meditat, firſt our Bleſſed Lord

Virgin hence; Fourthly, her Aſſumption into Heauen: Fiftly and laſtly her glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Coronation there, where she is declared Queene ouer the vniuerſal Kingdomes of heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>Where is to be noted, that for the obtaining of the Indulgences granted to the ſodality of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary (then which I do not knowe any more ample) it is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to meditat al theſe myſteries in order as we haue ſett them down; but it may ſuffice to entertaine ones mind the while, with medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating any one or two of them in which we ſhal find the greateſt deuotion, nay only to ſay our
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:95:253"/>beads ouer vocally (according to Nauarrs opinion) is ſufficient, ſo it be don with due attention and deuotion.</p>
               <p>Now for the more ignorant, that they may participat likewiſe of the fruit of deuotion, before they begin their beads I would counſel them, to frame an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the B. Virgin, in one of theſe three manners, as vulgarly they are accuſtomed to delineat her: Either with the Angel ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her, or holding her B. Sonne betwixt her armes, or finally al glorious in heauen, ready to heare and grant our Petition; and this there is none but may make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of, for the ſtirring them vp vnto deuotion; And that learned man Nauarr when he was fower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeares of age, not only
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:95:254"/>made vſe of this Imagination in reciting of the Roſary, but alſo in al his other deuotions, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſtill Imagined the dignity of the perſon to whom he directed them. Which manner of ſtirring vpp attention is both eaſy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatiue, and deuout, maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſpirit in attention and recollecting the memory the whilſt, &amp; opening a way to great familiarity with Alm. God and his B. Mother; which if (as we ought) we practiſe and eſteeme according vnto its dignity, we shal in short time make wondrous progreſſe in the way of ſpirit, and shal heape vp in heauen riches enough to make vs happy for al eternity. There only reſts, that I add to this, a moſt ſtupendious accident, by which we may ſee
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:95:254"/>the great importance of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, &amp; the great benefit thoſe of the Confraternity of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary enioy thereby, &amp; it is extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of a litle booke intitled, <hi>The Roſary of our Lady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At what time S. Dominik prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Kingdome of Aragon, a certaine yong Virgin of good account called Alexandria made inſtance vnto him as he came downe, from out of the Pulpit (where he had omitted nothing might make for the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Roſary) to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Sodality thereof, which ſhe obtained although for the reſt, her life was no wayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ſhe being one who ſpent much more time in ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her body, then to haue her ſoule wel adorned. Now it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:95:255"/>that two Gentlemen at once making ſuite vnto her, it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground of quarrel (as they in their madnes thought) one to challenge the other into the feild, where they both remayned dead vpon the place. The freinds of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearing of this ſad accident, and imagining her (as it was true) the cauſe to be revenged on her, they ruſhed into her houſe, and notwithſtanding ſhe deſired at leaſt, but ſo much reſpit as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe her ſelfe, they would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it her, but preſently cutt of her head, and threw it into a pitt. But our B. Lady, who has euer a ſpecial care of her deuoted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, (though neuer ſo defectiue) reuealed the fact vnto S. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, who in order to her merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful commands, went to the pit, &amp;
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:95:255"/>called on Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dria by her name, when behold (a wondrous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) the Angels viſibly in ſight of al the people, brought vp the head from the bottom of the pit, which ioyned vnto the body, ſhe beſought the Saint to heare her Confeſſion; which being done, ſhe declared three things worthy of particular note, arriued vnto her both before and after ſhe was dead: The firſt, that by vertue of her being of the Confraternity of the Roſary, ſhe had a perfect act of Contrition at the inſtant of her death, without which infallibly ſhe had died eternally: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that aſſoone as ſhe was dead, the diuels putting her to great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright, ſhe was maruelouſly ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; comforted by the glorious Queene of Heauen: The third,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:95:256"/>that for Penance and ſatisfaction of the death of thoſe two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe was condemned to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory for two hundred yeares, &amp; for fiue hundred more, for her va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in attire the cauſe of, that ſo lamentable effect. But that ſhe hoped by the merits of the ſame Confraternity, to be ſoone deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from that puniſhment, and hauing ſayd this, after ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a liue two whole dayes, for the confirmation of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and to augment the deuotion of the Sodality: ſhe left this life againe, whoſe body was honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly interred by the ſodaliſts there. When fifteen dayes after, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared againe vnto S. Dominick al in glory clothed in reſplendant beames of light, declaring vnto him after a world of thankes for
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:95:256"/>the ineſtimable benefits ſhe had receiued of him, two things of eſpecial note concerning this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of the Roſary; the one was, that ſhe was delegated to him from the ſoules in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with a Petition to be likewiſe inrold in the Sodality, to receiue the benefit of it amongſt the reſt; The other, that the Angels much reioyced at the erection of his Sodality, and that God inſtiled himſelfe the Father of it, the B. Virgin the Mother, &amp;c. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſayd this, shee flew away to heauen.</p>
               <p>This example ought to be a great incitement vnto euery one to make themſelues of this Soda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the better to become participant thereof to recite eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weeke the whole Roſary, at
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:95:257"/>leaſt a payre of beads cannot be burthenſome vnto any one of what imployment ſoeuer they be; at the end of euery decad thereof they are to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found inclination, ſaying with hart and mouth: O moſt holy Mother of God, I adore you, and wishe the Saint and Angels may reuerence and adore you a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and a thouſand times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with whom I haue firme confidence through the grace of Almighty God, and your fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablé aſſiſtance, to bleſſe, praiſe, and adore you hereafter for euer and euermore.</p>

                  <p>THE firſt ſtarr, or rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues; which our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Lady is adorned with al, is her Eternal and particular <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination,</hi> who before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either of heauen or earth, &amp; before al times was diuinely ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and predeſtinated vnto ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, the plenitud of Grace, and the accumulation of al hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly guifts, to the end that she adorned therwith, might be the better diſpoſed to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception of the Eternal Word. The holy Church makes mention of her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine predeſtination in theſe
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:95:259"/>words of the holy Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto her: <hi>Dominus poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit me ab initio viarum ſuarum:</hi> the Lord hath had the poſſeſſion of me from the beginning of his wayes. And this other: <hi>Ab initio &amp; ante ſaecula Creata ſum, &amp;c.</hi> from the beginning I was created &amp; before al times. So S. Bernard diſcourſing with the B. Virgin vpon this point, <hi>You haue ben pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>in the Spirit of God, before al creatures, to the end you should ingender God himſelfe,</hi> This then is the firſt ſtarr which crownes the B.

                  <p>Hauing been then in ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular a manner of predeſtination elected before al creatures; by conſequence in excellency ſhe was to excel them al, for ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly being honoured with the greateſt dignity which a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could be capable of, she like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had as great grace and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity as in any Creature poſſibly could bee, with al the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments requiſit, for one who was to be Mother of Alm.

Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſpeaking it is true indeed, as deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant of Adam she should haue been ſubiect to original ſinne, as alſo al other miſeries which follow in trayne thereof, had not God with his ſuperabon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Grace preuented her, as one whom he had choſen to be his

                  <p>At the ſame inſtant as Alm. God created the ſoule of the B. Virgin, and infuſed it into her body, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> newly receiuing forme in S.

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:95:262"/>in it; but to ſay, in what aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance it was, not only exceeds my capacity and expreſſion, but that of al other creatures beſides. For God at that inſtant did not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her, as iſſuing from Adam a ſinner and his enemy, but as his Mother choſen out for the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our ſinnes, and to bruze the head and trample on the pride of the Infernal Enemy. Which being ſo, if (as they ſay) the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreal Heauen be compoſed of ſo noble a ſubſtance, and ſhine with ſo pure and rarified a light, only becauſe it is the medium, wherein the obiect of Alm.

<pb n="498" facs="tcp:95:263"/>was to vnit himſelfe to his holy Humanity.</p>
                  <p>And what a glory is this for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane one of their owne linage, not only thus exempte from al original and actual ſinne, but alſo from the very inſtant of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity, to begin to lead a life ful of grace, celeſtial, and diuine?

                  <p>And ſo great and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible is this diuine myſtery, as the B. Virgin her ſelfe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she were moſt extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily illuminated by the holy Ghoſt, yet could she not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, when the Angels tould it
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:95:267"/>her how it could be, that she who was a Virgin could conceiue a child without any detriment of her virginity, as appeareth by her; <hi>Quomodo fiet hoc, quoniam virum non cognoſco? &amp;c.</hi> neither could the Angel too informe her how? but he remitted her to the holy Ghoſt; <hi>Spiritus ſanctus ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniet in vos;</hi> for the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the myſtery. O myſtery of myſteries; &amp; maternal dignity to be admir'd both of Angels and men, and neuer ſufficiently to be vnderſtood! but let vs yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to delineat her prayſes more vnto the life.</p>
                  <p>When God out of the ribbs of <hi>Adam</hi> had framed <hi>Eue,</hi> he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of his ſleep, ſayd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; <hi>this now is bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh; wherfore a man is
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:95:268"/>to leaue both father and mother, and ioyning himſelf to his wife, to become one flesh with her.</hi> Let vs apply this myſtery now to our Sauiour Chriſt and ſay, that in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the humanity of our Sauiour Chriſt, by its vnion with God vnited humane nature ſo ſtraitly with the diuinity, that the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin might as properly ſay of our Sauiour Chriſt; this is flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone, &amp;c. ſeeing, as S. Auguſtin ſayes, the flesh of Chriſt, was the B. Virgin flesh.</p>
                  <p>From whence S. Peter Damian inferrs, that God not only was preſent to her by his vnlimited being as he is vniuerſally withal, nor by his grace as he is only with the Iuſt, but in a farr more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner of Identity, in that
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:95:268"/>that the ſonne of God, is her ſonne alſo, and (as we haue ſayd) flesh of her flesh, &amp;c. hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her the ſubſtance whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof his ſacred body was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, a dignity in her ſo great, as admiration muſt there take vp, where humane diſcourſe layes downe, and with its tongue of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence only celebrat it.</p>
                  <p>This ſo ſtreit vnion or Identity betwixt Alm. God and the B. Virgin, is by the Angelical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor S. Thomas ſtyled <hi>Parentela,</hi> or affinity betwixt God and her, which can be ſayd of no other creature liuing beſydes her ſelfe, neither of man nor Angel, to be naturally allyed, with God like her, hauing the natural ſonne of God for her ſonne. In conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, S. Anſelme ſayes;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:95:269"/>
                     <hi>The Eternal father had not the hart to ſuffer, that his only beloued ſonn, should be only his ſonn, but would withal he should be truly the only and natural ſonne of the B. Virgin alſo; and this not as of two ſeueral perſons but the perſon of the ſonn of God, was likewiſe the perſon of the ſonn of the Virgin alſo;</hi> and ſo the contrary. By which we ſee, that she was truely the Spouſe of the holy Ghoſt, who wrought in her womb the Conception of the ſonn of God, and by this she becomes euery way allyed vnto al the perſons of the B. Trinity. To conclude then, this dignity and prerogatiue we ſay (as we haue ſayd before) is the greateſt in a creature, as can poſſibly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>

                  <p>Neither (according to S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin and S.

                  <p>And what wonder is it, that she should ſeeme more diuine then humane, when ſhe was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued to ſuch a high degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencye, that she neuer fett into the leaſt defect, nor was euer tranſported ſo much as with the firſt motion of any diſordination;
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:95:281"/>which were no wonder, if (as a graue Authour affirmes) ſhe were borne impeccable, a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſayes he, but, in a manner, neceſſary for her, who was deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat to the high honour of being the Mother of Alm.

God tooke vpp al the lodging with in her for himſelfe; while she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering her owne humility on the one ſide, and the high honour on the other, to which God had aduanced her, was ſo ſtudious how to comply with her obligation to him for ſo great a benefitt, as her thoughts had neuer leaſure to thinke of any thing beſides; To ſay nothing of the abſolut morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of her body and exterior ſenſes, and the continual watch
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:95:282"/>the Angels kept ouer her by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that no euil should approch her, as one who was the liuing Tabernacle of the liuing God. As for the diuels, they fled her more then they follow others, as we may wel imagine if S. Antony, S. Bernard, and other Saints were ſo formidable to them as they durſt not approche their ſight; And for her, ſhe fled ſynne more then any wicked perſon followed it, as knowing that whoſoeuer ſinned, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> felt into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of Alm. God, a thing which of al other she dreaded moſt ſo as al her delight was in the exerciſe of vertue and ſanctity of life. To conclude, she deſpiſed al honours of the world, as knowing ſhe was ſhortly to go to the poſſeſſion of that ſupreme honour of being
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:95:282"/>Queene of Heauen hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then to diuert her from it; and al helps and incitements to it, how could ſhe chooſe but be perpetually in contemplation?</p>

                  <head>The Declaration of the Ninth Starr.</head>
                  <p>THe Ninth Starr of our B. Ladyes crowne, is the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity</hi> ſhe is exalted to, aboue al creatures both in Heauen and earth, which by proper name, we may cal her <hi>Exaltation;</hi> ſince by it she is exalted aboue the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſt heauens, aboue al the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Saints, and Hierarchies of Angels, as the holy Church ſings of her prayſe: <hi>Exaltata es ſancta
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:95:283"/>Dei genitrix ſuper choros Angelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ad Caeleſtia regna.</hi> Neither can we admire, that next vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the ſoueraine king of glory ſhould aduance her to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt he had, for ſhe being his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was a kind of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on his part to honour her and do her al good he could, ſince the honour which Children are bound to giue to their parents, Conſiſts not only in words and ceremonious reſpect, but much more in effect and really doing for them. Wherfore (ſayes Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polytus) he who hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this: <hi>Honora patrem &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem:</hi> honour thy father and thy mother, to fulfil the law which he himſelfe preſcribes to others, would not (we muſt ſuppoſe) be wanting to his Mother, in
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:95:283"/>ſoeuer honour grace and glory he could beſtow vpon her. Now al the priuiledges and aduantages aboue others which the B. virgin hath, are founded vpon theſe two principalls; the firſt, the infinit power of her B. ſonn; in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of which S. Auguſtin ſpeaking of her Aſſumption both in ſoule and body. ſayes, that God could do it and why he did it not, thoſe who denied it were to giue him a reaſon for it, The like argument we may vſe in point of the B. Virgins glory,</p>
                  <p>The ſeconc is her dignity in being the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> who is infinit, wherefore as the title of <hi>Sonn of God</hi> is the foundation on which we ground the excellency of the humanity of Chriſt; ſo the title of <hi>Mother of God,</hi> is that, on
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:95:284"/>which we ground al her preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, her ſingular graces, and her ſupreme glory; for natural reaſon teacheth vs that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is more nigh to her ſonne, (excepting the Father) then any other kynn. Wherefore the B. Virgin being the Mother of Ieſus Chriſt, who was Incarnat in her ſacred flesh, muſt needs be nigher her ſonne, in grace and glory, too, then any elſe beſids.</p>
                  <p>Soe he would not ranke her amongſt the Hierarchies of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, for then there had been others higher aduanced then she amongſt the Powers and Thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; nor amongſt them, becauſe the Cherubins and Seraphins ſurpaſt them in dignity; but next vnto himſelfe, as was moſt fitt, that his Mother might not
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:95:284"/>be inferiour vnto his ſeruants, nor the Queene vnto her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, where she ſitts enthroned with incredible pompe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, making a Hierarchie more high and excellent by her ſelfe, then any of them al.</p>
                  <p>But what vnderſtanding can comprehend, or what tongue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Glory she is poſſeſſed of? For if the eye hath neuer ſeen, the eare neuer heard, nor the hart of man euer conceiued, what God Alm. hath prepared for thoſe who loue him; how can one conceiue, what he hath prepared for her, who not only loued him, but brought him forth, nourished, educated, and ſerued him with ſuch affection &amp; diligence? Only this we may imagine and ſay of it that glory and felicity next to
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:95:285"/>Alm. Gods, is the greateſt that is in heauen, and that in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of creatures ſhe is holy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al holyes, happy aboue the happieſt, hath more grace then thoſe who haue moſt beſides, and hath more glory then the moſt glorious.</p>
                  <p>The holy Doctors ſpeake mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayles of this Exaltation of hers, and amongſt the reſt, S. Bernard ſayes, that the glory she enioyes in heauen, beares a proportion to the plenitud of grace she had on earth aboue al creatures els; and adds, that as on earth there was not a more ſanctified place then the ſacred Temple of the Virgins wombe, which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned God himſelfe, ſo in heauen there is not a more glorious then her Throne, where she ſitts exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:95:285"/>at the right hand of God. In another place he ſayes, the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of man cannot conceiue her glory, nor his tongue declare it, which puts the Inhabitants of heauen it ſelfe to their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in beholding it. Andraeas Cretenſis ſayes, that her glory can not be comprehended, for that it exceeds the glory of al the Saints and Angels putt together. S. Iohn Damaſcen, that there is a mighty difference betwixt the ſeruants and the Mother of God. S. Iohn Chriſoſtom, that the B. Virgin is more glorious incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably then the Seraphins. B. Laurentius Iuſtinianus, that al the glory and felicity which in ſcattered peeces is diſtributed amongſt the Saints, is found vnited in the B. Virgin And the
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:95:286"/>Seraphike S. Bonauenture ſayes, that the greatnes and goodnes of God doth more manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the B. Virgin only, then in al the reſt of creatures, and that al their perfections are in a more excellent manner to be found in her then them; and he concludes, that as in grace and merits she ſurpaſſeth al other Saints, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doth ſhe in felicity and glory. This and much to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is ſayd by them of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins high exaltation anſwerable to the height of her other merits and prerogatiues, who being Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, the ſupremeſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity which any creature could be aduanced vnto, on earth. Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to it is this ninth Starr, and one of the brighteſt in her glorious Crowne of being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanc't

Let vs then acknowledge her authority ouer al, to be as great and vnlimited as her wil. In conſideraton of whoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes S.

                  <p>Ieſus Chriſt (ſays S. Bernard) was ſufficient) it is true) for our

                  </p>
                  <p>And this cannot but be a great comfort to poore ſinners, that they know they haue with the Eternal Iudge ſuch an Aduocat ſtil preſent, or rather a mother indeed who is his mother alſo. For ſo in the perſon of S. Iohn,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:95:292"/>our Sauiour on the Croſſe by theſe words, <hi>Woman behold thy ſonne,</hi> commended her for mother vnto vs al; at which time ſhe had two ſonnes on Mount Caluary both dead, the one in body, the other in ſoule, one by the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the croſſe, the other by languishing of ſpirit; of which one was her natural ſonne, the other only by adoption, the one innocent the other culpable. This in theſe words S. Anſelme would ſay: <hi>O shure refuge that we haue,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the Mother of God is our mother alſo, and either of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſuffred death, in his paſsion, the one vpon the croſſe, the other by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity; Iudge you in what bitternes of mind the while was the B.

From whence we may perceiue, how great her mercy is to her deuoted ſeruants, to ſinners who haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto her; and finally to al, in that she is the Mother of God, the Mother of grace and mercy, the mediatrix betwixt God and man, one, of the greateſt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes she hath in heauen.</p>

Her ſonne being a braue and noble ſpirit, dying in the holy warrs, she anxious for his ſoule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the B. Virgin to reueale vnto her, in what eſtate it was;
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:95:300"/>when behold, when she was in the greateſt feruour of her deuotion, the B. Virgin appeared vnto her, and comforted her in this ſort; my deare daughter, ſayd she, be no longer ſolicitous for your ſonne, for I haue taken care of his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in viſiting him before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, and rendring his hart inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible to al ſorts of temptations, and ſo as no doubt of faith could bow it from the rectitud it was in, nay more, I made the paſſage of death both ſweet and eaſy for him, to the end the feare and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of it might not tranſport him either to impatience or deſpaire. So, I cleared his chamber of thoſe diuels aſſembled there, to lay ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res for his ſoule, and intrapp it at its departure thence, and at the inſtant of his ſoule and bodyes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:95:301"/>I took it in my ne ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, vnder the protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which, I caryed it ſafe away from its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal enemyes.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon of this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dernes of hers she declared in another reuelation, when one day the holy Saint making her prayers at the Sepulcher of Chriſt, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisht in extaſy into a ſumptuous Pallace, where she beheld our Sauiour Chriſt on an Imperial Throne, and his B. Mother ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his ſide, with an infinity of Angels incircling them about; Preſently after, she beheld her ſonne preſent, al trembling &amp; in great diſmay before this Thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to receiue his Iudgement there, his Angel Guardian on his right hand, and the diuel on his left, who with a horrible
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:95:301"/>voyce thus cryed out: moſt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Iudge, I appeale to you for Iuſtice, and right of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt iniury that was euer offered me; your Mother againſt al equity hath rauisht that wicked ſoule out of my hands, entring his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at the houre of his death, and excluding me and my company, hath debarred me of that priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which you haue granted me, to tempt euery ſoule at the article of tyme, when it wil beſt be teſtified whether they belong to me or you, then which grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter iniuſtice can there be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? To this, the B. Virgin an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, though thou art the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lyes, yet in this thou haſt but declared the truth, I haue don al this indeed, and my reaſon for it was this: This ſoule, while it
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:95:302"/>was couuerſant in the world, was ſo deuoted to me, as it reioyced and tooke complacency in my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of being Mother of Alm.

<pb n="577" facs="tcp:95:302"/>ſoule heer, who being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto the yeares of diſcretion, in ſteed of taking the right hand way of your commandements, went on the left, in his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them; wherefore I demand but Iuſtice that he be condemned; and heer he inſiſted in particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing his mortal and venial ſins; at this, his good Angel inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelfe ſaying; thou wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked feind, al this is but true, I grant what thou haſt ſayd; but knoweſt thou not, that his holy Mothers prayers inceſſantly offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp vnto Alm. God for him, haue cancelled theſe, and obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for him a true contrition, and ſacramental abſolution for them before he dyed; beſides her, and his many other holy workes don in ſatisfaction of them, how then
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:95:303"/>canſt thou haue the impudence to vrge them any more? goe home, and keepe company with damned ſoules, looke not after him, for he is a ſaued one. At this, the diuel vaniſhed away.</p>
                  <p>And by this we may ſee, the benefit of being deuoted to the B. Virgin, of the prayers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for them, and of dying in a good eſtate, prepared vnto it by true contrition and Confeſſion.</p>

Secondly, you shal do as much; in memory of the Ioy I had in viſiting my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Elizabeth: and ſo forth, vnto the ſeauenth Ioy I had; which you shal conclude with the laſt three <hi>Aue Marias</hi> of your Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ſo the whole number wil amount to 7. <hi>Paters</hi> and 63. <hi>Aue Marias;</hi> which deuotion if you shal dayly performe in mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:95:308"/>know you shal much more pleaſe me, then in that other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion which you had; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſayd this, she vaniſhed away, leauing him exceedingly comforted and ſtrengthened in his vocation. Now it hapned that whilſt one day he was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this deuotion, a certaine Religious beholding him by chance, ſawe an Angel ſtanding by him, threading on a golden thread, as many roſes as the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice ſayd <hi>Aue Marias,</hi> and for each <hi>Paternoſter</hi> a golden lilly: al which when the Nouice had done he ioined them together, and crowned his head with them; the Religious man aſtoniſhed at this viſion, charged him by vertue of holy obedience, to declare vnto him what deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he vſed; which
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:95:308"/>he doing with great ſincerity, the Religious man encouraged him to perſiſt therin, aſſuring him it was a deuotion the B. Virgin was delighted with.</p>
               <p>And S. Bernard exerciſing this deuotion our B. Lady appeared vnto him once, ſaying vnto him; my ſonne, this deuotion of thine, is exceeding grateful to me, and that thou mayſt perceiue ſo much, I haue obtained of my ſonne for thee in reward thereof, the grace of preaching, and of working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; beſides, I promiſe you, one day to make you participant of thoſe Ioyes which you dayly cal to remembrance; and <hi>de facto</hi> ſoone after, the holy Saint began to be famous indeed for miracles, and to abound in innumerable graces, and conuerted a world of
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:95:309"/>ſoules by his learned preachings and force of his miracles.</p>

<pb n="591" facs="tcp:95:309"/>places and times accomodate for them, we wilonly ſpeak of ſuch interiour Adorations as we may be exerciſing, they being only acts of adoration produced by the Wil; which according to S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, are thoſe which the Bleſſed in heauen only exhibitvnto Alm. God. Theſe then, there is none but may performe, when in the performance of the others, they are hindred either for want of commodity of place or time, and theſe indeed are the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of al, and moſt acceptable to Alm. God, as thoſe without which the others were nothing worth.</p>
               <p>And it being our principal ſcope, to treat of reuerencing the Mother of God, we wil only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifye in that, and inſtruct her votaries in the place, and Time,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:95:310"/>when and where they are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be exerciſed. In al times and places they may comodiouſly be produced, but cheifly when for the company of others we cannot exerciſe any other deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as alſo when we ride, walke, eate, or take repoſe; at al which times it is but lifting vp our mind to heauen, and to ſay with our hart: I humbly adore you, O B. mother of my Sauiour Chriſt; I adore you O Queene of Angels, or the like; in only doing of which, we ſanctify al we do, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king euery one of thoſe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent actions, aequiualent to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer: happy the ground they goe on, happy the bread they eate, &amp; the reſt they take, who are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed the while; So when the Clock ſtrikes, it were a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:95:310"/>in this ſort to eleuat our mind, as alſo before each Houre of our B. Ladyes Office, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing an act of interiour compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, ſaying with our heart: I exceedingly reioice O B. Virgin, for your high honor of being Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, of being Queene of heauen, &amp;c. which cannot but be moſt acceptable and grateful vnto her. In the meane time this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion were beſt perfomed on their knees, it being a poſture moſt repugnant to ſlouth and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity.</p>
               <p>Beſides, for thoſe who are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with infirmity, age, or any other weaknes, this deuotion were beſt, as that which without any difficulty they may performe, ſince there is none but haue their ſpirit free, or at leaſt ſo free, as
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:95:311"/>for a glance or ſo they may reflect it vpon heauen, how euer other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are incumbreds, And a great conſolation this ought to be to euery one, that without any other paynes, then the only lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the mind to God, ſo it be don with ſpirit and viuacity, one may merit ſo much, as to arriue to moſt high perfection. When one then, is ſitting by the fire, or repoſing on the bed, let them but exerciſe their mindes in theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior acts of deuotion, and euen when they ſeeme to men moſt idle, they shal appeare vnto God moſt vertuouſly imployed. O moſt happy imployment, that a man in a manner doing nothing, may do as the very Angels in heauen, And while ſome, to finde out ſolitud and deuotion, retire
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:95:311"/>them to the Deſarts, and liue Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites liues, he that exerciſeth but theſe adorations, hath al that within himſelf, which they ſeeke abrode, and may aſſoone arriue to the height of perfection by this eaſy way, as by the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable they can go. Beſides, theſe acts of Adoration haue yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit, that they expoſe vs not to vainglory, which others perhaps may do, as being only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and our ſelues perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the interiour of our ſoule, which by ſo much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobles them aboue the other, as the ſoule exceeds the body in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and therfore of the bodyes operations we are to haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard at al, further then they go acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with the attention of the mind, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </p>
               <p>But to returne to our purpoſe, the ſeruant of the Queene of heauen is to the vttermoſt bent of ſpirit and induſtry to imploy himſelfe in theſe interiour Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as farr forth as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time place, &amp; occaſion ſhal giue him leaue. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he is to haue regard the while to accompany them (if he can) with exterior reuerence both becauſe the one much aydes the other, as alſo becauſe the neglect of them alwayes implyes an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable negligence; which that Example which Pelbert recounts, doth wel declare, happening in his time in Hungary, and recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him by a Religious man of worthy credit, and it is this:
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:95:312"/>A Religious of the ſame Order was accuſtomed euer at the <hi>Aue Maria</hi> bel, or <hi>Angelus Domini,</hi> to riſe out of his bed at the houres of night, and humbly on his knees ſalute the Queen of heauen; This deuout cuſtome once, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by ſlouth and lazines, he omitted, when behold, being falne a ſleepe againe, he ſeemed in his ſleepe to ſee, the Church ſteeple eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> incline it ſelf vnto the ground; which ſight three times being repreſented vnto him in ſleepe, at laſt he imagined that he heard theſe words; Miſerable and neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t creature as thou art, art thou not aſhamed to ſee euen ſenſleſſe creatures thus bow down themſelues in reuerence to the Mother of God, whilſt thou ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as thou art, neglecteſt it? by
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:95:313"/>which viſion touched with a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow for this neglect, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more feruorous thereafter in his deuotions.</p>
               <p>Theſe interiour Reuerences then, although of themſelues they be of neuer ſo high worth and dignity, yet when commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly they may be done, we are neuer to neglect the exteriour, but ſtil accompany the one with the other, that the feruour of the one ioyned with the other payne may render them more merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and the beſt place for the exerciſing theſe deuotions is, when the commodity of ſome Chappel or Oratory is offred vs, at which time we are vpon our knees, in a more particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to commend our ſelues to Alm. God and his B. Mother; And
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:95:313"/>of this we haue for paterne our Sauiour Chriſt, who as often as he aſcended to Hieruſalem, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred euer to the Temple, the firſt thing he did, to offer vp to his eternal Father his prayers and adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. In imitation of which, thoſe of the Capucines Order haue a conſtitution, that when they arriue in any place, they are firſt of al to reſort vnto the Church, and there to adore the Bleſſed Sacrament: the words of the Conſtitution are theſe: Being arriued to the place where we are to goe, to shew our ſelues true ſonnes of the Eternal father, we are firſt to viſit the Church, where hauing don reuerence, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And diuers by theſe meanes haue eſcaped imminent dangers; as appeares by this following
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:95:314"/>ſtory, recounted by the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iames Voragius Archbishop of Genua, in his hiſtory of the B. Virgins Aſſumption.</p>
               <p>There was (ſayes he) a perſon of quality, whoſe wife excelled in al vertues, but principally in deuotion to the B. Virgin, ſo as no day paſt that in ſome reuerent and Religious manner she did not honour her. Now it happened that her husband through his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue prodigality, at laſt fel into want and miſery, in ſo much as one day ſome noble men inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues to dinner with him, and he wanting meanes to entertayne them, in that ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and aboundant manner as he was wont, to avoyd the shame went forth into a wood, where he intended to abſent himſelf while
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:95:314"/>they might be come and gone without taking notice of their viſiting him; whilſt in a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coly paſſion he wandred vp and down then revoluing in his mind into what miſery he was falne, behold a perſon of a horrible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, mounted vpon a horſe no leſſe horrid then he appeared vnto him, requeſting him to let him know his cauſe of diſcontent; To whom the Gentleman (after he had recollected his ſpirits which feare with its diſmay, had putt to flight at firſt) declared his whole fortunes; at which (quoth the other) if that be al, take comfort, for I wil promiſe you (grant me but one requeſt) to reduce you to an eſtate more riche and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then euer you were in before; It muſt be a ſtrange requeſt (ſayd
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:95:315"/>the Gentleman) I ſhould not grant you vpon that condition; nay, it is but eaſy in performance ſayd the diuel) for it was he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed in that ſhape) to witt, that on ſuch a certaine day and houre you bring your wife along with you, and meete me in this place: &amp; this being agreed vpon, the diuel directed him to a caue, where he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a mighty treaſure, by the helpe of which, recouering out of his neceſſity, he liued in a more noble way then euer. Now it hapned, the time drawing nigh, when (as he had promiſed) he was to take his iourney with his wife vnto the place appointed. and she perceiuing that ſom-what extraordinary was in hand, by his haſty warning her to prepare to take horſe with him, and the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:95:315"/>of his Countenance, when she could by no meanes gett out of him what it was; ſhe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the matter to the B. Virgin, &amp; preſently tooke horſe ſo obedient to her husband, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to examine further his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Now it hapned on their way, that paſſing by a litle Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel dedicated to our B. Lady, the Lady by the conſent of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band lighted and went in, only in mind to do her deuotions, and returne againe; but behold, whilſt with prayers and teares she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Queene of heauen the good ſucceſſe of her affayres, she was diuinely caſt into a ſleepe meane while the B. Virgin aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her shape, and with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band went on her way.</p>
               <p>They were no ſooner arriued
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:95:316"/>at the entry of the wood, but the diuel with great noyſe and furie appeared vnto the Gentleman, not daring to approch vnto him for feare of our B. Lady (whom preſently he knew) but caſting on him a ſterne regard in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſpake vnto him; vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and perfidious as thou art, is this al the reward I haue, for thoſe great benefits thou haſt receiued of me? didſt thou not promiſe to conduct thy wife hither vnto me, and in her ſteed had thou brought heer the mother of Alm. God? It was againſt thy wife (ſince againſt this I cannot) I intended to auenge my ſelfe, for her being ſo diligent in the honour and firme affection to the Queene of heauen.</p>
               <p>Wherunto the B. Virgin thus
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:95:316"/>anſwered him: and whence is this temerity thou abhominable Feind, that thou ſhouldſt dare to offer any iniury to thoſe who loue and reuerence me? goe hence to Hel againe, and deſiſt from mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them, vpon payne of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hel, then euer yet thou feltſt; When the diuel with a violent clatter, as if al the wood had been torne vp by the rootes, ſtrait va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished away, and left the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in ſuch affright, as he fell flatt to the ground before the B. Virgins feet, beſeeching her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his offence; who sharply reprehending him for it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to goe back vnto the Chappel, to awake his wife out of her trance, and returning home with her, to diſcharge his houſe of al thoſe il gotten goods, ſo dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:95:317"/>to keepe: Al which he punctually did, and quitting both thoſe goods and his euil together, he became in short time of more plentiful fortune, then euer he was before, by the ſpecial fauour of the Queene of heauen; who is alwayes ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and merciful to thoſe, who implore her ayde in their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſityes, and aduantage them with high graces and priuiledges, who endeauour to honour her with this excellent ſort of Adorations, as wel exterior as interior, which hitherto we haue largely trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of; together with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, diſcourſe, authority, and wondrous examples, which should induce vs to the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of it, which is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſcope and ayme of al this work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="607" facs="tcp:95:317"/>
And now at laſt, we haue brought it to an end, by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular fauour and aſſiſtance of Alm. God, obtained through the interceſſion of his glorious Mother, our moſt benigne and B. Lady; whom we beſeech by the ſame interceſſion, to render vs worthy of the participation at laſt of eternal good, which being only that, which can ſatiat indeed, can only render vs on al parts happy and content.</p>
